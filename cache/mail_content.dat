<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-39355</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 20:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Versions of FreeRDP on the 3.x release branch before beta3 are subject to a Use-After-Free in processing `RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packets. If `context-&gt;maxPlaneSize` is 0, `context-&gt;planesBuffer` will be freed. However, without updating `context-&gt;planesBuffer`, this leads to a Use-After-Free exploit vector. In most environments this should only result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3 and users of the beta 3.x releases are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39355'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39355</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-39354</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 20:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `nsc_rle_decompress_data` function. The Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because it processes `context-&gt;Planes` without  checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Should an attacker be able to leverage this vulnerability they may be able to cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39354'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39354</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-39353</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 21:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to a missing offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Read. In the `libfreerdp/codec/rfx.c` file there is no offset validation in `tile-&gt;quantIdxY`, `tile-&gt;quantIdxCb`, and `tile-&gt;quantIdxCr`. As a result crafted input can lead to an out of bounds read access which in turn will cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39353'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39353</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-39352</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 21:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an invalid offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Write. This can be triggered when the values `rect-&gt;left` and `rect-&gt;top` are exactly equal to `surface-&gt;width` and  `surface-&gt;height`. eg. `rect-&gt;left` == `surface-&gt;width` &amp;&amp; `rect-&gt;top` == `surface-&gt;height`. In practice this should cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39352'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39352</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-39351</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 20:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions of FreeRDP are subject to a Null Pointer Dereference leading a crash in the RemoteFX (rfx) handling.  Inside the `rfx_process_message_tileset` function, the program allocates tiles using `rfx_allocate_tiles` for the number of numTiles. If the initialization process of tiles is not completed for various reasons, tiles will have a NULL pointer. Which may be accessed in further processing and would cause a program crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39351'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39351</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-39350</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 20:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. This issue affects Clients only. Integer underflow leading to DOS (e.g. abort due to `WINPR_ASSERT` with default compilation flags). When an insufficient blockLen is provided, and proper length validation is not performed, an Integer Underflow occurs, leading to a Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade.
