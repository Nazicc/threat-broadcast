<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-39355</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-10-26 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39355'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39355</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-39348</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-10-26 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started with version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resource which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request implies that one is already in a privileged position. This issue was fixed in version 22.10.0rc1. There are no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39348'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39348</a>
