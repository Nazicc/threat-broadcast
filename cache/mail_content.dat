<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30608</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-18 22:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] sqlparse is a non-validating SQL parser module for Python. In affected versions the SQL parser contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service). This issue was introduced by commit `e75e358`. The vulnerability may lead to Denial of Service (DoS). This issues has been fixed in sqlparse 0.4.4 by commit `c457abd5f`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-30608'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-30608</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30606</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-18 22:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions a user logged as an administrator can call arbitrary methods on the `SiteSetting` class, notably `#clear_cache!` and `#notify_changed!`, which when done on a multisite instance, can affect the entire cluster resulting in a denial of service. Users not running in multisite environments are not affected. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-30606'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-30606</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30547</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-17 22:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. There exists a vulnerability in exception sanitization of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.16, allowing attackers to raise an unsanitized host exception inside `handleException()` which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.17` of `vm2`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-30547'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-30547</a>
