<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41919</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-22 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Typeâ€™s essence as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "multipart/form-data", or "text/plain", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2 and 3.29.4. As a workaround, implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using `@fastify/csrf'.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41919'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41919</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-39199</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-22 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. immudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish between different server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep the state for multiple servers. SDK does not validate this uuid and can accept any value reported by the server. A malicious server can change the reported UUID tricking the client to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state completely irrelevant to the one previously retrieved from the server. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1. As a workaround, when initializing an immudb client object a custom state handler can be used to store the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores the server UUID can be used to ensure that even if the server changes the UUID, client will still consider it to be the same server.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39199'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39199</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-2791</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-22 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulnerable to CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, and will upload any file written into the PLC logic folder to the connected PLC.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-2791'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-2791</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41943</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-22 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform. As a site admin it was possible to execute arbitrary commands on Gitserver when the experimental `customGitFetch` feature was enabled. This experimental feature has now been disabled by default. This issue has been patched in version 4.1.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41943'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41943</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41942</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-22 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform. In versions prior to 4.1.0 a command Injection vulnerability existed in the gitserver service, present in all Sourcegraph deployments. This vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation on the host parameter of the `/list-gitolite` endpoint. It was possible to send a crafted request to gitserver that would execute commands inside the container. Successful exploitation requires the ability to send local requests to gitserver. The issue is patched in version 4.1.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41942'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41942</a>
