<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36100</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform Applications Tag and XWiki Platform Tag UI are tag applications for XWiki, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 1.7 in XWiki Platform Applications Tag and prior to 13.10.6 and 14.4 in XWiki Platform Tag UI, the tags document `Main.Tags` in XWiki didn't sanitize user inputs properly. This allowed users with view rights on the document (default in a public wiki or for authenticated users on private wikis) to execute arbitrary Groovy, Python and Velocity code with programming rights. This also allowed bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. The vulnerability could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. On XWiki versions before 13.10.4 and 14.2, this can be combined with CVE-2022-36092, meaning that no rights are required to perform the attack. The vulnerability has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, the patch that fixes the issue can be manually applied to the document `Main.Tags` or the updated version of that document can be imported from version 14.4 of xwiki-platform-tag-ui using the import feature in the administration UI on XWiki 10.9 and later.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36100'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36100</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36099</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform Wiki UI Main Wiki is software for managing subwikis on XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 5.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 13.10.6 and 14.4, it's possible to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python and Velocity script macros via the request (URL parameter) using the `XWikiServerClassSheet` if the user has view access to this sheet and another page that has been saved with programming rights, a standard condition on a public read-only XWiki installation or a private XWiki installation where the user has an account. This allows arbitrary Groovy/Python/Velocity code execution which allows bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. Also, this could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. This has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, edit the affected document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` or `WikiManager.XWikiServerClassSheet` and manually perform the changes from the patch fixing the issue. On XWiki versions 12.0 and later, it is also possible to import the document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` from the xwiki-platform-wiki-ui-mainwiki package version 14.4 using the import feature of the administration application as there have been no other changes to this document since XWiki 12.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36099'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36099</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36098</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform Mentions UI is a user interface for mentioning users in wiki content for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 12.5-rc-1 and prior to versions 13.10.6 and 14.4, it's possible to store Javascript or groovy scripts in a mention, macro anchor, or reference field. The stored code is executed by anyone visiting the page with the mention. This issue has been patched on XWiki 14.4 and 13.10.6. As a workaround, one may update `XWiki.Mentions.MentionsMacro` and edit the `Macro code` field of the `XWiki.WikiMacroClass` XObject.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36098'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36098</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36097</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform Attachment UI provides a macro to easily upload and select attachments for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 14.0-rc-1 and prior to 14.4-rc-1, it's possible to store JavaScript in an attachment name, which will be executed by anyone trying to move the corresponding attachment. This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.4-rc-1. As a workaround, one may copy `moveStep1.vm` to `webapp/xwiki/templates/moveStep1.vm` and replace vulnerable code with code from the patch.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36097'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36097</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36096</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The XWiki Platform Index UI is an Index of all pages, attachments, orphans and deleted pages and attachments for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Prior to versions 13.10.6 and 14.3, it's possible to store JavaScript which will be executed by anyone viewing the deleted attachments index with an attachment containing javascript in its name. This issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10.6 and 14.3. As a workaround, modify fix the vulnerability by editing the wiki page `XWiki.DeletedAttachments` with the object editor, open the `JavaScriptExtension` object and apply on the content the changes that can be found on the fix commit.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36096'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36096</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36095</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to versions 13.10.5 and 14.3, it is possible to perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack for adding or removing tags on XWiki pages. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.5 and 14.3. As a workaround, one may locally modify the `documentTags.vm` template in one's filesystem, to apply the changes exposed there.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36095'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36095</a>
