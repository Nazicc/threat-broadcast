<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30614</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-19 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Pay is a payments engine for Ruby on Rails 6.0 and higher. In versions prior to 6.3.2 a payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments) the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality. This has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30614'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30614</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30612</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-19 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Cloud hypervisor is a Virtual Machine Monitor for Cloud workloads. This vulnerability allows users to close arbitrary open file descriptors in the Cloud Hypervisor process via sending malicious HTTP request through the HTTP API socket. As a result, the Cloud Hypervisor process can be easily crashed, causing Deny-of-Service (DoS). This can also be a potential Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability. Users require to have the write access to the API socket file to trigger this vulnerability.  Impacted versions of Cloud Hypervisor include upstream main branch, v31.0, and v30.0. The vulnerability was initially detected by our `http_api_fuzzer` via oss-fuzz. This issue has been addressed in versions 30.1 and 31.1. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring the write access to the API socket file is granted to trusted users only.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30612'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30612</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30611</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-19 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Discourse-reactions is a plugin that allows user to add their reactions to the post in the Discourse messaging platform. In affected versions data about what reactions were performed on a post in a private topic could be leaked. This issue has been addressed in version 0.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the discourse-reactions plugin to fully mitigate the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30611'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30611</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30610</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-19 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] aws-sigv4 is a rust library for low level request signing in the aws cloud platform. The `aws_sigv4::SigningParams` struct had a derived `Debug` implementation. When debug-formatted, it would include a user's AWS access key, AWS secret key, and security token in plaintext. When TRACE-level logging is enabled for an SDK, `SigningParams` is printed, thereby revealing those credentials to anyone with access to logs. All users of the AWS SDK for Rust who enabled TRACE-level logging, either globally (e.g. `RUST_LOG=trace`), or for the `aws-sigv4` crate specifically are affected. This issue has been addressed in a set of new releases. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable TRACE-level logging for AWS Rust SDK crates.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30610'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30610</a>

In affected versions Minecarts with chests will drop their items when teleporting through a portal; when they reappear, they will still have their items impacting the integrity of the game world. The teleport code has since been rewritten and is available in release `0.11.5.1`. Users are advised to upgrade.
