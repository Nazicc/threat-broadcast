The user is not visible in Usernames and Passwords menu list of the application and the password cannot be changed through any normal operation of the device.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28654'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28654</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28648</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-28 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Osprey Pump Controller version 1.01 inputs passed to a GET parameter are not properly sanitized before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML/JS code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28648'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28648</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28637</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-28 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] DataEase is an open source data visualization analysis tool. In Dataease users are normally allowed to modify data and the data sources are expected to properly sanitize data. The AWS redshift data source does not provide data sanitization which may lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability has been fixed in v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28637'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28637</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28631</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-28 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] comrak is a CommonMark + GFM compatible Markdown parser and renderer written in rust. A Comrak AST can be constructed manually by a program instead of parsing a Markdown document with `parse_document`. This AST can then be converted to HTML via `html::format_document_with_plugins`. However, the HTML formatting code assumes that the AST is well-formed. For example, many AST notes contain `[u8]` fields which the formatting code assumes is valid UTF-8 data. Several bugs can be triggered if this is not the case. Version 0.17.0 contains adjustments to the AST, storing strings instead of unvalidated byte arrays. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually validate UTF-8 correctness of all data when assigning to `&[u8]` and `Vec<u8>` fields in the AST. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-049`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28631'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28631</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28626</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-28 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] comrak is a CommonMark + GFM compatible Markdown parser and renderer written in rust. A range of quadratic parsing issues are present in Comrak. These can be used to craft denial-of-service attacks on services that use Comrak to parse Markdown. This issue has been addressed in version 0.17.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-047`<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28626'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28626</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28447</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-28 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Smarty is a template engine for PHP. In affected versions smarty did not properly escape javascript code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session. This may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data, manipulation of the web application's behavior, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user. Users are advised to upgrade to either version 3.1.48 or to 4.3.1 to resolve this issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28447'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28447</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28427</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-28 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. In versions prior to 24.0.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This vulnerability is distinct from GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32 which covers a similar issue. The issue has been patched in matrix-js-sdk 24.0.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28427'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28427</a>
