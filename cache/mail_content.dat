<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-26046</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-02 01:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality to protect against web-based attacks. In teler-waf prior to version 0.1.1 is vulnerable to bypassing common web attack rules when a specific HTML entities payload is used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application. The vulnerability exists due to teler-waf failure to properly sanitize and filter HTML entities in user input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions. This issue has been fixed in version 0.1.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-26046'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-26046</a>

User input was found not being properly escaped, which allowed malicious users to inject arbitrary HTML into the pages. The Content-Security-Policy forbids inline and external scripts so it is not possible to execute JavaScript code, unless in combination with other vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds, please upgrade to Pat-DB 1.0.2 or later.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-26042'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-26042</a>
