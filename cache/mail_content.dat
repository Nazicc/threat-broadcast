<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20802</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-27 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid agent credentials.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20802'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20802</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20797</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-27 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Network Analytics, formerly Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as an administrator on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands in the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make configuration changes on the affected device or cause certain services to restart unexpectedly.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20797'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20797</a>
