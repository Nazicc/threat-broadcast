<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31167</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-07 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform Security Parent POM contains the security APIs for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 5.0 and prior to 12.10.11, 13.10.1, and 13.4.6, a bug in the security cache stores rules associated to document Page1.Page2 and space Page1.Page2 in the same cache entry. That means that it's possible to overwrite the rights of a space or a document by creating the page of the space with the same name and checking the right of the new one first so that they end up in the security cache and are used for the other too. The problem has been patched in XWiki 12.10.11, 13.10.1, and 13.4.6. There are no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31167'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31167</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31166</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-07 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting in versions 11.3.7, 11.0.3, and 12.0RC1, it is possible to exploit a bug in XWikiRights resolution of groups to obtain privilege escalation. More specifically, editing a right with the object editor leads to adding a supplementary empty value to groups which is then resolved as a reference to XWiki.WebHome page. Adding an XWikiGroup xobject to that page then transforms it to a group, any user put in that group would then obtain the privileges related to the edited right. Note that this security issue is normally mitigated by the fact that XWiki.WebHome (and XWiki space in general) should be protected by default for edit rights. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.4 and 14.2RC1 to not consider anymore empty values in XWikiRights. It's possible to work around the problem by setting appropriate rights on XWiki.WebHome page to prevent users to edit it.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31166'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31166</a>

Versions prior to 0.12.0b2 are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. This vulnerability impacts everyone running ActivityWatch and gives the attacker full access to the ActivityWatch REST API. Users should upgrade to v0.12.0b2 or later to receive a patch. As a workaround, block DNS lookups that resolve to 127.0.0.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31149'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31149</a>
