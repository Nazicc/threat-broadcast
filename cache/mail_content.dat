The InfoScale VIOM web application is vulnerable to SQL Injection in some of the areas of the application. This allows attackers to submit arbitrary SQL commands on the back-end database to create, read, update, or delete any sensitive data stored in the database.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32569'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32569</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32568</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-10 05:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Veritas InfoScale Operations Manager (VIOM) before 7.4.2.800 and 8.x before 8.0.410. The VIOM web application does not validate user-supplied data and appends it to OS commands and internal binaries used by the application. An attacker with root/administrator level privileges can leverage this to read sensitive data stored on the servers, modify data or server configuration, and delete data or application configuration.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32568'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32568</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32071</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-09 16:15:15 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in versions 2.2-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1, it's possible to execute javascript with the right of any user by leading him to a special URL on the wiki targeting a page which contains an attachment. This has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.4, and 14.4.8. The easiest possible workaround is to edit file `&lt;xwiki app&gt;/templates/importinline.vm` and apply the modification described in commit 28905f7f518cc6f21ea61fe37e9e1ed97ef36f01.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32071'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32071</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32070</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-10 18:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to version 14.6-rc-1, HTML rendering didn't check for dangerous attributes/attribute values. This allowed cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via attributes and link URLs, e.g., supported in XWiki syntax. This has been patched in XWiki 14.6-rc-1. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a fixed version.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32070'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32070</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-2757</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-18 03:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on 'saveLang' functions in versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access functions to save plugin data that can potentially lead to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2757'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2757</a>
