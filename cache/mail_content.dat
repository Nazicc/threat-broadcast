<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36110</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-09 20:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. Prior to version 0.15.1, Improper Authorization functions lead to non-privileged users running privileged API calls. If someone adds users to the Netmaker platform who do not have admin privileges, they can use their auth tokens to run admin-level functions via the API. This problem has been patched in v0.15.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36110'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36110</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36109</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-09 18:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `&quot;USER $USERNAME&quot;` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT [&quot;su&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;user&quot;]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36109'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36109</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36108</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-13 18:15:15 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the `f:asset.css` view helper is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when user input is passed as variables to the CSS. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36108'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36108</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36107</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-13 18:15:15 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the `FileDumpController` (backend and frontend context) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when malicious files are displayed using this component. A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. Update to TYPO3 version 7.6.58 ELTS, 8.7.48 ELTS, 9.5.37 ELTS, 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36107'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36107</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36106</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-13 18:15:15 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36106'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36106</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36105</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-13 18:15:14 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that observing response time during user authentication (backend and frontend) can be used to distinguish between existing and non-existing user accounts. Extension authors of 3rd party TYPO3 extensions providing a custom authentication service should check if the extension is affected by the described problem. Affected extensions must implement new `MimicServiceInterface::mimicAuthUser`, which simulates corresponding times regular processing would usually take. Update to TYPO3 version 7.6.58 ELTS, 8.7.48 ELTS, 9.5.37 ELTS, 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix this problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36105'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36105</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36104</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-13 18:15:14 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. In affected versions requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 version 11.5.16 to resolve this issue. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36104'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36104</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36103</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-13 17:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36103'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36103</a>
