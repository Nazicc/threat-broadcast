Affected versions of zoneminder are subject to a vulnerability which allows users with "View" system permissions to inject new data into the logs stored by Zoneminder. This was observed through an HTTP POST request containing log information to the "/zm/index.php" endpoint. Submission is not rate controlled and could affect database performance and/or consume all storage resources. Users are advised to upgrade.

In affected versions authenticated users can bypass CSRF keys by modifying the request supplied to the Zoneminder web application. These modifications include replacing HTTP POST with an HTTP GET and removing the CSRF key from the request. An attacker can take advantage of this by using an HTTP GET request to perform actions with no CSRF protection. This could allow an attacker to cause an authenticated user to perform unexpected actions on the web application. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
