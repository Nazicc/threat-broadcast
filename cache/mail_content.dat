<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28447</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-28 21:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Smarty is a template engine for PHP. In affected versions smarty did not properly escape javascript code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session. This may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data, manipulation of the web application's behavior, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user. Users are advised to upgrade to either version 3.1.48 or to 4.3.1 to resolve this issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28447'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28447</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28444</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 20:15:15 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] angular-server-side-configuration helps configure an angular application at runtime on the server or in a docker container via environment variables. angular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory. During deployment of an Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file). With version 15.0.0 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and exposed via index.html. This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project that has no backend component. This vulnerability has been mitigated in version 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default. As a workaround, manually edit or create ngssc.json or run script after ngssc.json generation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28444'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28444</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28430</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-27 22:15:22 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OneSignal is an email, sms, push notification, and in-app message service for mobile apps.The Zapier.yml workflow is triggered on issues (types: [closed]) (i.e., when an Issue is closed). The workflow starts with full write-permissions GitHub repository token since the default workflow permissions on Organization/Repository level are set to read-write. This workflow runs the following step with data controlled by the comment `(${{ github.event.issue.title }} &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the full title of the Issue)`, allowing an attacker to take over the GitHub Runner and run custom commands, potentially stealing any secret (if used), or altering the repository. This issue was found with CodeQL using javascript&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Expression injection in Actions query. This issue has been addressed in the repositories github action. No actions are required by users. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-051`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28430'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28430</a>
