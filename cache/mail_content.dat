<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-31133</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-08 21:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Ghost is an app for new-media creators with tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters, and offer paid subscriptions to members. Prior to version 5.46.1, due to a lack of validation when filtering on the public API endpoints, it is possible to reveal private fields via a brute force attack.Ghost(Pro) has already been patched. Maintainers can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version below v5.46.1. v5.46.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, add a block for requests to `/ghost/api/content/*` where the `filter` query parameter contains `password` or `email`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31133'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31133</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-31129</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-08 21:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Contiki-NG operating system versions 4.8 and prior can be triggered to dereference a NULL pointer in the message handling code for IPv6 router solicitiations. Contiki-NG contains an implementation of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) in the module `os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c`. The ND protocol includes a message type called Router Solicitation (RS), which is used to locate routers and update their address information via the SLLAO (Source Link-Layer Address Option). If the indicated source address changes, a given neighbor entry is set to the STALE state.The message handler does not check for RS messages with an SLLAO that indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor entry can actually be created for the indicated address. The resulting pointer is used without a check, leading to the dereference of a NULL pointer of type `uip_ds6_nbr_t`.The problem has been patched in the `develop` branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in the upcoming 4.9 release. As a workaround, users can apply Contiki-NG pull request #2271 to patch the problem directly.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31129'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31129</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-31127</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-08 21:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] libspdm is a sample implementation that follows the DMTF SPDM specifications. A vulnerability has been identified in SPDM session establishment in libspdm prior to version 2.3.1. If a device supports both DHE session and PSK session with mutualauthentication, the attacker may be able to establish the session with `KEY_EXCHANGE` and `PSK_FINISH` to bypass the mutual authentication. This is most likely to happen when the Requester begins a session using one method (DHE, for example) and then uses the other method's finish (PSK_FINISH in this example) to establish the session. The session hashes would be expected to fail in this case, but the condition was not detected.This issue only impacts the SPDM responder, which supports `KEY_EX_CAP=1 and `PSK_CAP=10b` at same time with mutual authentication requirement. The SPDM requester is not impacted. The SPDM responder is not impacted if `KEY_EX_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=01b`. The SPDM responder is not impacted if mutual authentication is not required.libspdm 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 are all impacted. Older branches are not maintained, but users of the 2.3 branch may receive a patch in version 2.3.2. The SPDM specification (DSP0274) does not contain this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31127'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31127</a>

The HTML sanitizer, introduced in version 14.6-rc-1, allows the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid data attributes. This vulnerability does not affect restricted cleaning in HTMLCleaner as there attributes are cleaned and thus characters like `/` and `&gt;` are removed in all attribute names. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by making sure that data attributes only contain allowed characters. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31126'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31126</a>

An uncaught exception vulnerability was introduced in version 5.1.0 and included in version 4.1.0 of the `socket.io` parent package. Older versions are not impacted. A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io` package, including those who use depending packages like `socket.io`. This issue was fixed in version 6.4.2 of Engine.IO. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31125'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31125</a>

Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`, may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary for users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running their own instance may apply the patch manually.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31123'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31123</a>

This multiple upload has never been supported by forms.FileField or forms.ImageField (only the last uploaded file was validated). However, Django's &quot;Uploading multiple files&quot; documentation suggested otherwise.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31047'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31047</a>

Log4cxx compiled with ODBC support(before version 1.1.0, this was auto-detected at compile time)2. ODBCAppender enabled for logging messages to, generally done via a config file3. User input is logged at some point. If your application does not have user input, it is unlikely to be affected.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.1.0 which properly binds the parameters to the SQL statement, or migrate to the new DBAppender class which supports an ODBC connection in addition to other databases. Note that this fix does require a configuration file update, as the old configuration files will not configure properly.&Acirc;&nbsp; An example is shown below, and more information may be found in the Log4cxx documentation on the ODBCAppender.Example of old configuration snippet:&lt;appender name=&quot;SqlODBCAppender&quot; class=&quot;ODBCAppender&quot;&gt;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &lt;param name=&quot;sql&quot; value=&quot;INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ('%m')&quot; /&gt;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; ... other params here ...&lt;/appender&gt;The migrated configuration snippet with new ColumnMapping parameters:&lt;appender name=&quot;SqlODBCAppender&quot; class=&quot;ODBCAppender&quot;&gt;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp; &lt;param name=&quot;sql&quot; value=&quot;INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES (?)&quot; /&gt;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &lt;param name=&quot;ColumnMapping&quot; value=&quot;message&quot;/&gt;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; ... other params here ...&lt;/appender&gt;<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31038'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31038</a>
