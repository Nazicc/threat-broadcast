<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24844</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-13 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin, which separates the front and rear of the full stack. The problem occurs in the following code in server/service/system/sys_auto_code_pgsql.go, which means that PostgreSQL must be used as the database for this vulnerability to occur. Users must: Require JWT loginï¼‰ and be using PostgreSQL to be affected. This issue has been resolved in version 2.5.1. There are no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24844'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24844</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24828</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-13 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24828'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24828</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24818</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-13 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial data. The GeoTools library has a number of data sources that can perform unchecked JNDI lookups, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. Similar to the Log4J case, the vulnerability can be triggered if the JNDI names are user-provided, but requires admin-level login to be triggered. The lookups are now restricted in GeoTools 26.4, GeoTools 25.6, and GeoTools 24.6. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any downstream application should not allow usage of remotely provided JNDI strings.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24818'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24818</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24816</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-13 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] JAI-EXT is an open-source project which aims to extend the Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) API. Programs allowing Jiffle script to be provided via network request can lead to a Remote Code Execution as the Jiffle script is compiled into Java code via Janino, and executed. In particular, this affects the downstream GeoServer project. Version 1.2.22 will contain a patch that disables the ability to inject malicious code into the resulting script. Users unable to upgrade may negate the ability to compile Jiffle scripts from the final application, by removing janino-x.y.z.jar from the classpath.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24816'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24816</a>
