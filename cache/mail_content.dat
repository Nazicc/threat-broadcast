<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28114</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-22 19:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] `cilium-cli` is the command line interface to install, manage, and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters running Cilium. Prior to version 0.13.2,`cilium-cli`, when used to configure cluster mesh functionality, can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote clusters. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected by this issue. Due to an incorrect mount point specification, the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that `etcd` cluster. This issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2. As a workaround, one may use Cilium's Helm charts to create their cluster.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28114'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28114</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28005</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-22 06:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in Trend Micro Endpoint Encryption Full Disk Encryption version 6.0.0.3204 and below could allow an attacker with physical access to an affected device to bypass Microsoft Windows? Secure Boot process in an attempt to execute other attacks to obtain access to the contents of the device. An attacker must first obtain physical access to the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. It is also important to note that the contents of the drive(s) encrypted with TMEE FDE would still be protected and would NOT be accessible by the attacker by exploitation of this vulnerability alone.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28005'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28005</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-27977</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-21 12:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity vulnerability exists in the Data Server that could cause access to delete files in the IGSS project report directory, this could lead to loss of data when an attacker sends specific crafted messages to the Data Server TCP port. Affected Products: IGSS Data Server(IGSSdataServer.exe)(V16.0.0.23040 and prior), IGSS Dashboard(DashBoard.exe)(V16.0.0.23040 and prior), Custom Reports(RMS16.dll)(V16.0.0.23040 and prior).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-27977'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-27977</a>
