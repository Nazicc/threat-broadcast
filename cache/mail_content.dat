<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34104</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-06 18:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] fast-xml-parser is an open source, pure javascript xml parser. fast-xml-parser allows special characters in entity names, which are not escaped or sanitized. Since the entity name is used for creating a regex for searching and replacing entities in the XML body, an attacker can abuse it for denial of service (DoS) attacks. By crafting an entity name that results in an intentionally bad performing regex and utilizing it in the entity replacement step of the parser, this can cause the parser to stall for an indefinite amount of time. This problem has been resolved in v4.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using DOCTYPE parsing by setting the `processEntities: false` option.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-34104'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-34104</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34102</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-05 23:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. The polymorphic field type stores the classes to operate on when updating a record with user input, and does not validate them in the back end. This can lead to unexpected behavior, remote code execution, or application crashes when viewing a manipulated record. This issue has been addressed in commit `ec117882d` which is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to limit access to untrusted users until a new release is made.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-34102'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-34102</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34097</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-05 21:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] hoppscotch is an open source API development ecosystem. In versions prior to 2023.4.5 the database password is exposed in the logs when showing the database connection string. Attackers with access to read system logs will be able to elevate privilege with full access to the database. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-34097'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-34097</a>
