Linux ASMCallGraph before commit 20dba06bd1a3cf260612d4f21547c25002121cd5 allows attackers to cause a remote code execution on the server side via uploading a crafted ZIP file due to incorrect filtering rules of uploaded file. The problem has been patched in commit 20dba06bd1a3cf260612d4f21547c25002121cd5. There are no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-39346'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-39346</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2020-26082</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-04 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the zip decompression engine of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass content filters that are configured on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of password-protected zip files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious file inside a crafted zip-compressed file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured content filters that would normally drop the email.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-26082'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-26082</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2020-26065</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-04 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct path traversal attacks and obtain read access to sensitive files on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files on the affected system.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-26065'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-26065</a>

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write files within the affected application.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-26064'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-26064</a>
