<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40185</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-23 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] shescape is simple shell escape library for JavaScript. This may impact users that use Shescape on Windows in a threaded context. The vulnerability can result in Shescape escaping (or quoting) for the wrong shell, thus allowing attackers to bypass protections depending on the combination of expected and used shell. This bug has been patched in version 1.7.4.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40185'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40185</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40178</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-23 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Node-SAML is a SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. The lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be reused multiple times even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. This could impact the user where they would be logged out from an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are sent out in mass to different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale. This issue was patched in version 4.0.5.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40178'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40178</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40177</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-23 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can use the content field of their user profile page to execute arbitrary scripts with programming rights, thus effectively performing rights escalation. This issue is present since version 4.3M2 when AppWithinMinutes Application added support for the Content field, allowing any wiki page (including the user profile page) to use its content as an AWM Content field, which has a custom displayer that executes the content with the rights of the ``AppWithinMinutes.Content`` author, rather than the rights of the content author. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1. The fix is in the content of the AppWithinMinutes.Content page that defines the custom displayer. By using the ``display`` script service to render the content we make sure that the proper author is used for access rights checks.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40177'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40177</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40035</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-23 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Craft is a CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond. Bypassing the validatePath function can lead to potential remote code execution. This vulnerability can lead to malicious control of vulnerable systems and data exfiltrations. Although the vulnerability is exploitable only in the authenticated users, configuration with ALLOW_ADMIN_CHANGES=true, there is still a potential security threat (Remote Code Execution). This issue has been patched in version 4.4.15 and version 3.8.15.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40035'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40035</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40176</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-23 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can exploit a stored XSS through their user profile by setting the payload as the value of the time zone user preference. Even though the time zone is selected from a drop down (no free text value) it can still be set from JavaScript (using the browser developer tools) or by calling the save URL on the user profile with the right query string. Once the time zone is set it is displayed without escaping which means the payload gets executed for any user that visits the malicious user profile, allowing the attacker to steal information and even gain more access rights (escalation to programming rights). This issue is present since version 4.1M2 when the time zone user preference was introduced. The issue has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40176'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40176</a>

All versions of Argo CD starting from version 2.6.0 have a bug where open web terminal sessions do not expire. This bug allows users to send any websocket messages even if the token has already expired. The most straightforward scenario is when a user opens the terminal view and leaves it open for an extended period. This allows the user to view sensitive information even when they should have been logged out already. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: 2.6.14, 2.7.12 and 2.8.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40025'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40025</a>
