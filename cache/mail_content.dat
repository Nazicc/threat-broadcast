<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-34776</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-08-22 15:15:16 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Tabit - giftcard stealth. Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described APIs, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a 'tiny URL' in tabits domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 character long string containing numbers, lower and upper case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-34776'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-34776</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-34775</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-08-22 15:15:16 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Tabit - Excessive data exposure. Another endpoint mapped by the tiny url, was one for reservation cancellation, containing the MongoDB ID of the reservation, and organization. This can be used to query the http://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/rsv/management/{reservationId}?organization={orgId} API which returns a lot of data regarding the reservation (OWASP: API3): Name, mail, phone number, the number of visits of the user to this specific restaurant, the money he spent there, the money he spent on alcohol, whether he left a deposit etc. This information can easily be used for a phishing attack.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-34775'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-34775</a>
