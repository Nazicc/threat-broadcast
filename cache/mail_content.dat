<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40576</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `RleDecompress` function. This Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because FreeRDP processes the `pbSrcBuffer` variable without checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Insufficient data in the `pbSrcBuffer` variable may cause errors or crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40576'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40576</a>

Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `general_LumaToYUV444` function. This Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because processing is done on the `in` variable without checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Insufficient data for the `in` variable may cause errors or crashes. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40187</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions of the 3.x beta branch are subject to a Use-After-Free issue in the `avc420_ensure_buffer` and `avc444_ensure_buffer` functions. If the value of `piDstSize[x]` is 0, `ppYUVDstData[x]` will be freed. However, in this case `ppYUVDstData[x]` will not have been updated which leads to a Use-After-Free vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3. Users of the 3.x beta releases are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40187'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40187</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40186</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-31 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an IntegerOverflow leading to Out-Of-Bound Write Vulnerability in the `gdi_CreateSurface` function. This issue affects FreeRDP based clients only. FreeRDP proxies are not affected as image decoding is not done by a proxy. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade.
