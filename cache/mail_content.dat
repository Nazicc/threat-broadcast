<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-1457</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-25 21:15:06 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ** DISPUTED ** A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X 2.0.9-hotfix.6. Affected is an unknown function of the component Static Routing Configuration Handler. The manipulation of the argument next-hop-interface leads to command injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. VDB-223302 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor position is that post-authentication issues are not accepted as vulnerabilities.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1457'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1457</a>

This leads to a StackOverflowError exception being thrown.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1436'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1436</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-1410</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-23 08:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability in the Graphite FunctionDescription tooltip. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due the value of the Function Description was not properly sanitized. An attacker needs to have control over the Graphite data source in order to manipulate a function description and a Grafana admin needs to configure the data source, later a Grafana user needs to select a tampered function and hover over the description. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.22, 9.2.15 and 9.3.11 to receive a fix.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1410'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1410</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-1370</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-22 06:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] [Json-smart](https://netplex.github.io/json-smart/) is a performance focused, JSON processor lib. When reaching a &acirc;&euro;&tilde;[&acirc;&euro;&tilde; or &acirc;&euro;&tilde;{&acirc;&euro;&tilde; character in the JSON input, the code parses an array or an object respectively. It was discovered that the code does not have any limit to the nesting of such arrays or objects. Since the parsing of nested arrays and objects is done recursively, nesting too many of them can cause a stack exhaustion (stack overflow) and crash the software.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1370'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1370</a>
