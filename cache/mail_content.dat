<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-30276</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-26 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Motorola MOSCAD and ACE line of RTUs through 2022-05-02 omit an authentication requirement. They feature IP Gateway modules which allow for interfacing between Motorola Data Link Communication (MDLC) networks (potentially over a variety of serial, RF and/or Ethernet links) and TCP/IP networks. Communication with RTUs behind the gateway is done by means of the proprietary IPGW protocol (5001/TCP). This protocol does not have any authentication features, allowing any attacker capable of communicating with the port in question to invoke (a subset of) desired functionality.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30276'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30276</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-30274</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-26 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 uses ECB encryption unsafely. It can communicate with an XRT LAN-to-radio gateway by means of an embedded client. Credentials for accessing this gateway are stored after being encrypted with the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode using a hardcoded key. Similarly, the ACE1000 RTU can route MDLC traffic over Extended Command and Management Protocol (XCMP) and Network Layer (XNL) networks via the MDLC driver. Authentication to the XNL port is protected by TEA in ECB mode using a hardcoded key.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30274'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30274</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-30272</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-26 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 mishandles firmware integrity. It utilizes either the STS software suite or ACE1000 Easy Configurator for performing firmware updates. In case of the Easy Configurator, firmware updates are performed through access to the Web UI where file system, kernel, package, bundle, or application images can be installed. Firmware updates for the Front End Processor (FEP) module are performed via access to the SSH interface (22/TCP), where a .hex file image is transferred and a bootloader script invoked. File system, kernel, package, and bundle updates are supplied as RPM (RPM Package Manager) files while FEP updates are supplied as S-rec files. In all cases, firmware images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30272'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30272</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-30271</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-26 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 ships with a hardcoded SSH private key and initialization scripts (such as /etc/init.d/sshd_service) only generate a new key if no private-key file exists. Thus, this hardcoded key is likely to be used by default.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30271'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30271</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-30270</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-26 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 has default credentials. It exposes an SSH interface on port 22/TCP. This interface is used for remote maintenance and for SFTP file-transfer operations that are part of engineering software functionality. Access to this interface is controlled by 5 preconfigured accounts (root, abuilder, acelogin, cappl, ace), all of which come with default credentials. Although the ACE1000 documentation mentions the root, abuilder and acelogin accounts and instructs users to change the default credentials, the cappl and ace accounts remain undocumented and thus are unlikely to have their credentials changed.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30270'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30270</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-30269</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-26 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Motorola ACE1000 RTUs through 2022-05-02 mishandle application integrity. They allow for custom application installation via either STS software, the C toolkit, or the ACE1000 Easy Configurator. In the case of the Easy Configurator, application images (as PLX/DAT/APP/CRC files) are uploaded via the Web UI. In case of the C toolkit, they are transferred and installed using SFTP/SSH. In each case, application images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30269'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30269</a>

An attacker can use qq.createMapContext to create a MapContext object, use MapContext.moveToLocation to move the center of the map to the device's location, and use MapContext.getCenterLocation to get the latitude and longitude of the current map center.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-33057'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-33057</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31207</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-26 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31207'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31207</a>
