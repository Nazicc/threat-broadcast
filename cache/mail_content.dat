<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22451</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-02 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-22451'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-22451</a>
