<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29210</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-15 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the notification preferences macros can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of the user parameter of the macro that provide the notification filters. These macros are used in the user profiles and thus installed by default in XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29210'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29210</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29209</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-15 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the legacy notification activity macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of the macro parameters of the legacy notification activity macro. This macro is installed by default in XWiki. The vulnerability can be exploited via every wiki page that is editable including the user's profile, but also with just view rights using the HTMLConverter that is part of the CKEditor integration which is bundled with XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29209'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29209</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29208</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-15 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. Rights added to a document are not taken into account for viewing it once it's deleted. Note that this vulnerability only impact deleted documents that where containing view rights: the view rights provided on a space of a deleted document are properly checked. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10 by checking the rights of current user: only admin and deleter of the document are allowed to view it.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29208'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29208</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29207</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-15 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The Livetable Macro wasn't properly sanitizing column names, thus allowing the insertion of raw HTML code including JavaScript. This vulnerability was also exploitable via the Documents Macro that is included since XWiki 3.5M1 and doesn't require script rights, this can be demonstrated with the syntax `{{documents id="example" count="5" actions="false" columns="doc.title, before<script>alert(1)</script>after"/}}`. Therefore, this can also be exploited by users without script right and in comments. With the interaction of a user with more rights, this could be used to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, modifying or deleting content. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29207'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29207</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29206</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-15 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. There was no check in the author of a JavaScript xobject or StyleSheet xobject added in a XWiki document, so until now it was possible for a user having only Edit Right to create such object and to craft a script allowing to perform some operations when executing by a user with appropriate rights. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9-rc-1 by only executing the script if the author of it has Script rights.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29206'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29206</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29205</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-15 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The HTML macro does not systematically perform a proper neutralization of script-related html tags. As a result, any user able to use the html macro in XWiki, is able to introduce an XSS attack. This can be particularly dangerous since in a standard wiki, any user is able to use the html macro directly in their own user profile page. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8RC1. The patch involves the HTML macros and are systematically cleaned up whenever the user does not have the script correct.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29205'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29205</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29204</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-15 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. It is possible to bypass the existing security measures put in place to avoid open redirect by using a redirect such as `//mydomain.com` (i.e. omitting the `http:`). It was also possible to bypass it when using URL such as `http:/mydomain.com`. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.10, 14.4.4 and 14.8RC1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29204'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29204</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29203</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-15 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. It's possible to list some users who are normally not viewable from subwiki by requesting users on a subwiki which allows only global users with `uorgsuggest.vm`. This issue only concerns hidden users from main wiki. Note that the disclosed information are the username and the first and last name of users, no other information is leaked. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.8, 14.4.3 and 14.7RC1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29203'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29203</a>
