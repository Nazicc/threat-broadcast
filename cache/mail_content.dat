<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24864</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Origin Protocol is a blockchain based project. The Origin Protocol project website allows for malicious users to inject malicious Javascript via a POST request to `/presale/join`. User-controlled data is passed with no sanitization to SendGrid and injected into an email that is delivered to the founders@originprotocol.com. If the email recipient is using an email program that is susceptible to XSS, then that email recipient will receive an email that may contain malicious XSS. Regardless if the email recipient’s mail program has vulnerabilities or not, the hacker can at the very least inject malicious HTML that modifies the body content of the email. There are currently no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24864'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24864</a>

Databasir 1.01 has remote code execution vulnerability. JDBC drivers are not validated prior to use and may be provided by users of the system. This can lead to code execution by any basic user who has access to the system. Users are advised to upgrade.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-0540</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in Jira Seraph allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication by sending a specially crafted HTTP request. This affects Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center versions before 8.13.18, versions 8.14.0 and later before 8.20.6, and versions 8.21.0 and later before 8.22.0. This also affects Atlassian Jira Service Management Server and Data Center versions before 4.13.18, versions 4.14.0 and later before 4.20.6, and versions 4.21.0 and later before 4.22.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-0540'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-0540</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24799</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] wire-webapp is the web application interface for the wire messaging service. Insufficient escaping in markdown “code highlighting” in the wire-webapp resulted in the possibility of injecting and executing arbitrary HTML code and thus also JavaScript. If a user receives and views such a malicious message, arbitrary code is injected and executed in the context of the victim. This allows the attacker to fully control the user account. Wire-desktop clients that are connected to a vulnerable wire-webapp version are also vulnerable to this attack. The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp 2022-03-30-production.0 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552 or wire-server 2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0), so that their applications are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ### Patches * The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp **2022-03-30-production.0** and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. * On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag **2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552** or wire-server **2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0)**, so that their applications are no longer affected. ### Workarounds * No workarounds known ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory feel free to email us at [vulnerability-report@wire.com](mailto:vulnerability-report@wire.com) ### Credits We thank [Posix](https://twitter.com/po6ix) for reporting this vulnerability<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24799'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24799</a>
