<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-29468</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-14 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Texas Instruments (TI) WiLink WL18xx MCP driver does not limit the number of information elements (IEs) of type XCC_EXT_1_IE_ID or XCC_EXT_2_IE_ID that can be parsed in a management frame. Using a specially crafted frame, a buffer overflow can be triggered that can potentially lead to remote code execution. This affects WILINK8-WIFI-MCP8 version 8.5_SP3 and earlier.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29468'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-29468</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28483</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-14 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. The GSQL query language provides users with the ability to write data to files on a remote TigerGraph server. The locations that a query is allowed to write to are configurable via the GSQL.FileOutputPolicy configuration setting. GSQL queries that contain UDFs can bypass this configuration setting and, as a consequence, can write to any file location to which the administrative user has access.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28483'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28483</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28482</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-14 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. A single TigerGraph instance can host multiple graphs that are accessed by multiple different users. The TigerGraph platform does not protect the confidentiality of any data uploaded to the remote server. In this scenario, any user that has permissions to upload data can browse data uploaded by any other user (irrespective of their permissions).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28482'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28482</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28481</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-14 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. There is unsecured write access to SSH authorized keys file. Any code running as the tigergraph user is able to add their SSH public key into the authorised keys file. This allows an attacker to obtain password-less SSH key access by using their own SSH key.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28481'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28481</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28480</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-14 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. The TigerGraph platform allows users to define new User Defined Functions (UDFs) from C/C++ code. To support this functionality TigerGraph allows users to upload custom C/C++ code which is then compiled and installed into the platform. An attacker who has filesystem access on a remote TigerGraph system can alter the behavior of the database against the will of the database administrator; thus effectively bypassing the built in RBAC controls.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28480'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28480</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40312</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-14 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Multiple reflected XSS were found on different JSP files with unsanitized parameters in OpenMNS Horizon 31.0.8 and versions earlier than 32.0.2 on multiple platforms that an attacker can modify to craft a malicious XSS payload. The solution is to upgrade to Meridian 2023.1.6, 2022.1.19, 2021.1.30, 2020.1.38 or Horizon 32.0.2 or newer. Meridian and Horizon installation instructions state that they are intended for installation within an organization's private networks and should not be directly accessible from the Internet.
