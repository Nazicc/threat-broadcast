<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34243</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-08 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TGstation is a toolset to manage production BYOND servers. In affected versions if a Windows user was registered in tgstation-server (TGS), an attacker could discover their username by brute-forcing the login endpoint with an invalid password. When a valid Windows logon was found, a distinct response would be generated. This issue has been addressed in version 5.12.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may be mitigated by rate-limiting API calls with software that sits in front of TGS in the HTTP pipeline such as fail2ban.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34243'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34243</a>
