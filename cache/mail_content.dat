<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-41316</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-07 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. Due to lack of validation field - Org Name, bad actor can send emails with HTML injected code to the victims. Registered users can inject HTML into unsanitized emails from the Tolgee instance to other users. This unsanitized HTML ends up in invitation emails which appear as legitimate org invitations. Bad actors may direct users to malicious website or execute javascript in the context of the users browser. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.29.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-41316'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-41316</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20194</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-07 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the ERS API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator-level privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper privilege management in the ERS API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges beyond the sphere of their intended access level, which would allow them to obtain sensitive information from the underlying operating system. Note: The ERS is not enabled by default. To verify the status of the ERS API in the Admin GUI, choose Administration > Settings > API Settings > API Service Settings.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20194'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20194</a>

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator-level privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper privilege management in the ESR console. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges to root and read, write, or delete arbitrary files from the underlying operating system of the affected device. Note: The ESR is not enabled by default and must be licensed. To verify the status of the ESR in the Admin GUI, choose Administration > Settings > Protocols > IPSec.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20193'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20193</a>
