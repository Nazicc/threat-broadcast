<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20967</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-20 07:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against other users of the application web-based management interface. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to an application feature before storage within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating entries within the application interface that contain malicious HTML or script code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious HTML or script code within the application interface for use in further cross-site scripting attacks. Cisco has not yet released software updates that address this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20967'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20967</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20965</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-20 07:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to take privileges actions within the web-based management interface. This vulnerability is due to improper access control on a feature within the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing features through direct requests, bypassing checks within the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take privileged actions within the web-based management interface that should be otherwise restricted. {{value}} [&quot;%7b%7bvalue%7d%7d&quot;])}]]<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20965'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20965</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20964</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-20 07:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input within requests as part of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating requests to the web-based management interface to contain operating system commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web services user. Cisco has not yet released software updates that address this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20964'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20964</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20751</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-03 04:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the Snort detection engine integration for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause unlimited memory consumption, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient memory management for certain Snort events. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IP packets that would generate specific Snort events on an affected device. A sustained attack could cause an out of memory condition on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to interrupt all traffic flowing through the affected device. In some circumstances, the attacker may be able to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20751'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20751</a>

This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed packets that are received on the Lightspeed-Plus line cards. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Lightspeed-Plus line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition for any traffic that traverses that line card.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20714'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20714</a>
