<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37481</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-18 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing data privacy requests and privacy regulations. The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload zip files containing malicious SVG bombs (similar to a billion laughs attack), causing resource exhaustion in Admin UI browser tabs and creating a persistent denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`). This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37481'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37481</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37480</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-18 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing data privacy requests and privacy regulations. The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit a weakness in the connector template upload feature to upload a malicious zip bomb file, resulting in resource exhaustion and service unavailability for all users of the Fides webserver. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading. If an attack occurs, the impact can be mitigated by manually or automatically restarting the affected container.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37480'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37480</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37477</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-18 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] 1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. An OS command injection vulnerability exists in 1Panel firewall functionality. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. 1Panel firewall functionality `/hosts/firewall/ip` endpoint read user input without validation, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application, which execute system commands. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system, which can lead to a complete compromise of the system. This issue has been addressed in commit `e17b80cff49` which is included in release version `1.4.3`. Users are advised to upgrade.
