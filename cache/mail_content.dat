<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37582</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-12 10:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The RocketMQ NameServer component still has a remote command execution vulnerability as the CVE-2023-33246 issue was not completely fixed in version 5.1.1. When NameServer address are leaked on the extranet and lack permission verification, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using the update configuration function on the NameServer component to execute commands as the system users that RocketMQ is running as. It is recommended for users to upgrade their NameServer version to 5.1.2 or above for RocketMQ 5.x or 4.9.7 or above for RocketMQ 4.x to prevent these attacks.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37582'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37582</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37579</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-12 10:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Pulsar Function Worker.This issue affects Apache Pulsar: before 2.10.4, and 2.11.0.Any authenticated user can retrieve a source's configuration or a sink's configuration without authorization. Many sources and sinks contain credentials in the configuration, which could lead to leaked credentials. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that there is not a known way for an authenticated user to enumerate another tenant's sources or sinks, meaning the source or sink name would need to be guessed in order to exploit this vulnerability.The recommended mitigation for impacted users is to upgrade the Pulsar Function Worker to a patched version.2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.4.2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1.3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users are unaffected.Any users running the Pulsar Function Worker for 2.9.* and earlier should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37579'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37579</a>

If an attacker is connecting through the Pulsar Proxy, there is no known way to exploit this authorization vulnerability.There are two known risks for affected users. First, an attacker could produce garbage messages to any topic in the cluster. Second, an attacker could produce messages to the topic level policies topic for other tenants and influence topic settings that could lead to exfiltration and/or deletion of messages for other tenants.2.8 Pulsar Broker users and earlier are unaffected.2.9 Pulsar Broker users should upgrade to one of the patched versions.2.10 Pulsar Broker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.4.2.11 Pulsar Broker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1.3.0 Pulsar Broker users are unaffected.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30428'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30428</a>
