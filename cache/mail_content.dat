<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24716</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-03-08 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Unauthenticated users can leak the contents of files of the local system accessible to the web-server user, including `icingaweb2` configuration files with database credentials. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2. Database credentials should be rotated.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24716'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24716</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24715</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-03-08 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Authenticated users, with access to the configuration, can create SSH resource files in unintended directories, leading to the execution of arbitrary code. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2. Users unable to upgrade should limit access to the Icinga Web 2 configuration.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24715'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24715</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24714</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-03-08 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24714'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24714</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24713</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-03-08 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24713'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24713</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-41241</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-03-08 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud server is a self hosted system designed to provide cloud style services. The groupfolders application for Nextcloud allows sharing a folder with a group of people. In addition, it allows setting "advanced permissions" on subfolders, for example, a user could be granted access to the groupfolder but not specific subfolders. Due to a lacking permission check in affected versions, a user could still access these subfolders by copying the groupfolder to another location. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.14, 21.0.6 or 22.2.1. Users unable to upgrade should disable the "groupfolders" application in the admin settings.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-41241'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-41241</a>
