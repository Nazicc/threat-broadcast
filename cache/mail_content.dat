<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46137</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 21:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Prior to version 23.10.0rc1, when sending multiple HTTP requests in one TCP packet, twisted.web will process the requests asynchronously without guaranteeing the response order. If one of the endpoints is controlled by an attacker, the attacker can delay the response on purpose to manipulate the response of the second request when a victim launched two requests using HTTP pipeline. Version 23.10.0rc1 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46137'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46137</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46136</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 18:17:36 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46136'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46136</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46135</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 18:17:36 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] rs-stellar-strkey is a Rust lib for encode/decode of Stellar Strkeys. A panic vulnerability occurs when a specially crafted payload is used.`inner_payload_len` should not above 64. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.0.8.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46135'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46135</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46128</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 18:17:36 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nautobot is a Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. In Nautobot 2.0.x, certain REST API endpoints, in combination with the `?depth=&lt;N&gt;` query parameter, can expose hashed user passwords as stored in the database to any authenticated user with access to these endpoints. The passwords are not exposed in plaintext. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.0.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46128'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46128</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46126</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 18:17:36 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in runtime environments, helping enforce privacy regulations in code. The Fides web application allows users to edit consent and privacy notices such as cookie banners. The vulnerability makes it possible to craft a payload in the privacy policy URL which triggers JavaScript execution when the privacy notice is served by an integrated website. The domain scope of the executed JavaScript is that of the integrated website. Exploitation is limited to Admin UI users with the contributor role or higher. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46126'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46126</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46125</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 18:17:36 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers&acirc;&euro;&trade; addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46125'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46125</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46124</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 18:17:36 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in runtime environments, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides web application allows a custom integration to be uploaded as a ZIP file containing configuration and dataset definitions in YAML format. It was discovered that specially crafted YAML dataset and config files allow a malicious user to perform arbitrary requests to internal systems and exfiltrate data outside the environment (also known as a Server-Side Request Forgery). The application does not perform proper validation to block attempts to connect to internal (including localhost) resources. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46124'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46124</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46123</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 18:17:36 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] jumpserver is an open source bastion machine, professional operation and maintenance security audit system that complies with 4A specifications. A flaw in the Core API allows attackers to bypass password brute-force protections by spoofing arbitrary IP addresses. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can effectively make unlimited password attempts by altering their apparent IP address for each request. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.8.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46123'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46123</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46120</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-25 18:17:36 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The RabbitMQ Java client library allows Java and JVM-based applications to connect to and interact with RabbitMQ nodes. `maxBodyLebgth` was not used when receiving Message objects.  Attackers could send a very large Message causing a memory overflow and triggering an OOM Error. Users of RabbitMQ may suffer from  DoS attacks from RabbitMQ Java client which will ultimately exhaust the memory of the consumer. This vulnerability was patched in version 5.18.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46120'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-46120</a>
