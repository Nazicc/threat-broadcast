<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-35988</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-16 22:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `tf.linalg.matrix_rank` receives an empty input `a`, the GPU kernel gives a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c55b476aa0e0bd4ee99d0f3ad18d9d706cd1260a. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-35988'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-35988</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-35987</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-16 22:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. `DenseBincount` assumes its input tensor `weights` to either have the same shape as its input tensor `input` or to be length-0. A different `weights` shape will trigger a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit bf4c14353c2328636a18bfad1e151052c81d5f43. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-35987'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-35987</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-35957</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-20 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions prior to 9.1.6 and 8.5.13 are vulnerable to an escalation from admin to server admin when auth proxy is used, allowing an admin to take over the server admin account and gain full control of the grafana instance. All installations should be upgraded as soon as possible. As a workaround deactivate auth proxy following the instructions at: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/auth-proxy/<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-35957'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-35957</a>

Versions prior to 2.3.5 are subject to Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the SFTPGo WebClient, allowing remote attackers to inject malicious code. This issue is patched in version 2.3.5. No known workarounds exist.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39220'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39220</a>
