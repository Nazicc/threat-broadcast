<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20739</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:13 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user. The attacker must be authenticated on the affected system as a low-privileged user to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because a file leveraged by a root user is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a specific file as a lower-privileged user and then waiting until an admin user executes specific commands. The commands would then be executed on the device by the root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected system from a low-privileged user to the root user.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20739'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20739</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20737</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-03 04:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the handler for HTTP authentication for resources accessed through the Clientless SSL VPN portal of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device or to obtain portions of process memory from an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing specific HTTP authentication messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to an affected device acting as a VPN Gateway. To send this malicious traffic, an attacker would need to control a web server that can be accessed through the Clientless SSL VPN portal. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition, or to retrieve bytes from the device process memory that may contain sensitive information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20737'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20737</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20735</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:13 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. These actions could include modifying the system configuration and deleting accounts.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20735'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20735</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20729</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-03 04:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in CLI of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject XML into the command parser. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input in commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject XML into the command parser, which could result in unexpected processing of the command and unexpected command output.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20729'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20729</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20725</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:13 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20717</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:13 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the NETCONF process of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause an affected device to run out of memory, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient memory management when an affected device receives large amounts of traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20717'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20717</a>

This vulnerability is due to improper access control on files within the affected system. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying certain files on the vulnerable device. If successful, the attacker could gain escalated privileges and take actions on the system with the privileges of the root user.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20716'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20716</a>

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of errors that are logged as a result of client connections that are made using remote access VPN. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20715'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-20715</a>
