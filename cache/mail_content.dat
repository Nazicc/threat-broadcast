<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-3058</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-02 13:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in 07FLY CRM up to 1.2.0. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component User Profile Handler. The manipulation leads to cross site scripting. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-230560.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-3058'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-3058</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30571</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-29 20:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Libarchive through 3.6.2 can cause directories to have world-writable permissions. The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those directories.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-30571'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-30571</a>
