<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33195</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-27 04:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Craft is a CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33192</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-27 04:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ntpd-rs is an NTP implementation written in Rust. ntpd-rs does not validate the length of NTS cookies in received NTP packets to the server. An attacker can crash the server by sending a specially crafted NTP packet containing a cookie shorter than what the server expects. The server also crashes when it is not configured to handle NTS packets. The issue was caused by improper slice indexing. The indexing operations were replaced by safer alternatives that do not crash the ntpd-rs server process but instead properly handle the error condition. A patch was released in version 0.3.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33192'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33192</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33188</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-27 04:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Omni-notes is an open source note-taking application for Android. The Omni-notes Android app had an insufficient path validation vulnerability when displaying the details of a note received through an externally-provided intent. The paths of the note's attachments were not properly validated, allowing malicious or compromised applications in the same device to force Omni-notes to copy files from its internal storage to its external storage directory, where they would have become accessible to any component with permission to read the external storage. Updating to the newest version (6.2.7) of Omni-notes Android fixes this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33188'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33188</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32688</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-27 04:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] parse-server-push-adapter is the official Push Notification adapter for Parse Server. The Parse Server Push Adapter can crash Parse Server due to an invalid push notification payload. This issue has been patched in version 4.1.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32688'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32688</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32686</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-27 04:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and automated testing. Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files from being uploaded. The upload validation checks were not robust enough which left the possibility of an attacker to circumvent them and upload a potentially dangerous file. Exploiting this flaw, a combination of files could be uploaded so that they work together to circumvent the existing Content-Security-Policy and allow execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. This issue has been patched in version 12.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32686'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32686</a>
