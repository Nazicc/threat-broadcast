<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41939</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-19 01:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] knative.dev/func is is a client library and CLI enabling the development and deployment of Kubernetes functions. Developers using a malicious or compromised third-party buildpack could expose their registry credentials or local docker socket to a malicious `lifecycle` container. This issues has been patched in PR #1442, and is part of release 1.8.1. This issue only affects users who are using function buildpacks from third-parties; pinning the builder image to a specific content-hash with a valid `lifecycle` image will also mitigate the attack.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41939'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41939</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41938</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-19 01:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Flarum is an open source discussion platform. Flarum's page title system allowed for page titles to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when pages were rendered. The change was made after `v1.5` and was not noticed. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML markup using a discussion title input, either by creating a new discussion or renaming one. The XSS attack occurs after a visitor opens the relevant discussion page. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` are impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core `v1.6.2`. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` have to upgrade as soon as possible to v1.6.2. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41938'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41938</a>
