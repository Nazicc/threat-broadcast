<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23933</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-03 20:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OpenSearch Anomaly Detection identifies atypical data and receives automatic notifications. There is an issue with the application of document and field level restrictions in the Anomaly Detection plugin, where users with the Anomaly Detector role can read aggregated numerical data (e.g. averages, sums) of fields that are otherwise restricted to them. This issue only affects authenticated users who were previously granted read access to the indexes containing the restricted fields. This issue has been patched in versions 1.3.8 and 2.6.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23933'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23933</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23931</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-07 21:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23931'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23931</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23925</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-03 20:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Switcher Client is a JavaScript SDK to work with Switcher API which is cloud-based Feature Flag. Unsanitized input flows into Strategy match operation (EXIST), where it is used to build a regular expression. This may result in a Regular expression Denial of Service attack (reDOS). This issue has been patched in version 3.1.4. As a workaround, avoid using Strategy settings that use REGEX in conjunction with EXIST and NOT_EXIST operations.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23925'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23925</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23912</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-09 20:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability, found in EdgeRouters Version 2.0.9-hotfix.5 and earlier and UniFi Security Gateways (USG) Version 4.4.56 and earlier with their DHCPv6 prefix delegation set to dhcpv6-stateless or dhcpv6-stateful, allows a malicious actor directly connected to the WAN interface of an affected device to create a remote code execution vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23912'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23912</a>
