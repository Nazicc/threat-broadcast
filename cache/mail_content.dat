<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-39357</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Winter is a free, open-source content management system based on the Laravel PHP framework. The Snowboard framework in versions 1.1.8, 1.1.9, and 1.2.0 is vulnerable to prototype pollution in the main Snowboard class as well as its plugin loader. The 1.0 branch of Winter is not affected, as it does not contain the Snowboard framework. This issue has been patched in v1.1.10 and v1.2.1. As a workaround, one may avoid this issue by following some common security practices for JavaScript, including implementing a content security policy and auditing scripts.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39357'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39357</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20959</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the External RESTful Services (ERS) API of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated administrator of the web-based management interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20959'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20959</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20933</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z3 Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of client-supplied parameters while establishing an SSL VPN session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request and sending it to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to crash and restart, resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN connections and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and re-authenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established. Note: When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention. Cisco Meraki has released software updates that address this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20933'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20933</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20822</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read and delete files on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains certain character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or delete specific files on the device that their configured administrative level should not have access to. Cisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20822'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20822</a>
