<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2020-11083</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2020-07-14 21:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In October from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.466, a user with access to a markdown FormWidget that stores data persistently could create a stored XSS attack against themselves and any other users with access to the generated HTML from the field.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2020-11074</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2020-07-02 17:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In PrestaShop from version 1.5.3.0 and before version 1.7.6.6, there is a stored XSS when using the name of a quick access item. The problem is fixed in 1.7.6.6.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-11074'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-11074</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2020-11061</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2020-07-10 20:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In Bareos Director less than or equal to 16.2.10, 17.2.9, 18.2.8, and 19.2.7, a heap overflow allows a malicious client to corrupt the director's memory via oversized digest strings sent during initialization of a verify job. Disabling verify jobs mitigates the problem. This issue is also patched in Bareos versions 19.2.8, 18.2.9 and 17.2.10.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-11061'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-11061</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2020-11054</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2020-05-07 21:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In qutebrowser versions less than 1.11.1, reloading a page with certificate errors shows a green URL. After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow (colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However, when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green (colors.statusbar.url.success_https). While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl_strict to false, which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of security. This has been fixed in 1.11.1 and 1.12.0. All versions of qutebrowser are believed to be affected, though versions before v0.11.x couldn't be tested. Backported patches for older versions (greater than or equal to 1.4.0 and less than or equal to 1.10.2) are available, but no further releases are planned.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-11054'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-11054</a>
