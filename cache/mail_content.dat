<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22454</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-05 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, pending post titles can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. Pending posts can be created by unprivileged users when a category has the "require moderator approval of all new topics" setting set. This vulnerability can lead to a full XSS on sites which have modified or disabled Discourse’s default Content Security Policy. A patch is available in versions 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-22454'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-22454</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22453</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-05 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the number of times a user posted in an arbitrary topic is exposed to unauthorized users through the `/u/username.json` endpoint. The issue is patched in version 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16. There is no known workaround.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-22453'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-22453</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-46177</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-05 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, when a user requests for a password reset link email, then changes their primary email, the old reset email is still valid. When the old reset email is used to reset the password, the Discourse account's primary email would be re-linked to the old email. If the old email address is compromised or has transferred ownership, this leads to an account takeover. This is however mitigated by the SiteSetting `email_token_valid_hours` which is currently 48 hours. Users should upgrade to versions 2.8.14 or 3.0.0.beta15 to receive a patch. As a workaround, lower `email_token_valid_hours ` as needed.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-46177'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-46177</a>
