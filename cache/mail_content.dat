<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-27179</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A malicious actor having access to the exported configuration file may obtain the stored credentials and thereby gain access to the protected resource. If the same passwords were used for other resources, further such assets may be compromised.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-27179'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-27179</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-26519</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] There is no limit to the number of attempts to authenticate for the local configuration pages for the Hills ComNav Version 3002-19 interface, which allows local attackers to brute-force credentials.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26519'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26519</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-26516</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Authorized users may install a maliciously modified package file when updating the device via the web user interface. The user may inadvertently use a package file obtained from an unauthorized source or a file that was compromised between download and deployment.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26516'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26516</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-1318</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Hills ComNav version 3002-19 suffers from a weak communication channel. Traffic across the local network for the configuration pages can be viewed by a malicious actor. The size of certain communications packets are predictable. This would allow an attacker to learn the state of the system if they can observe the traffic. This would be possible even if the traffic were encrypted, e.g., using WPA2, as the packet sizes would remain observable. The communication encryption scheme is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-1318'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-1318</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-1039</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The weak password on the web user interface can be exploited via HTTP or HTTPS. Once such access has been obtained, the other passwords can be changed. The weak password on Linux accounts can be accessed via SSH or Telnet, the former of which is by default enabled on trusted interfaces. While the SSH service does not support root login, a user logging in using either of the other Linux accounts may elevate to root access using the su command if they have access to the associated password.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-1039'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-1039</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-0567</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A flaw was found in ovn-kubernetes. This flaw allows a system administrator or privileged attacker to create an egress network policy that bypasses existing ingress policies of other pods in a cluster, allowing network traffic to access pods that should not be reachable. This issue results in information disclosure and other attacks on other pods that should not be reachable.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-0567'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-0567</a>
