Any user can create their own server in your cloud and become an admin so this vulnerability could affect the cloud infrastructure. This attack vector also may increase the impact of XSS to RCE which is dangerous for self-hosted users as well.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23917'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23917</a>

The number of acceptable &quot;links&quot; in this &quot;decompression chain&quot; wascapped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply byusing many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a &quot;malloc bomb&quot;, making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23916'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23916</a>

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly fail when multiple transfers are done in parallel as the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recentlycompleted transfer. A later HTTP-only transfer to the earlier host name would then *not* get upgraded properly to HSTS.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23915'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23915</a>

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of usingan insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. ThisHSTS mechanism would however surprisingly be ignored by subsequent transferswhen done on the same command line because the state would not be properlycarried on.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23914'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23914</a>

OWSLib's XML parser (which supports both `lxml` and `xml.etree`) does not disable entity resolution, and could lead to arbitrary file reads from an attacker-controlled XML payload. This affects all XML parsing in the codebase. This issue has been addressed in version 0.28.1. All users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround is to patch the library manually.
