<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-32847</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-20 17:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior, a malicious guest can trigger a vulnerability in the host by abusing the disk driver that may lead to the disclosure of the host memory into the virtualized guest. This issue is fixed in commit cf60095a4d8c3cb2e182a14415467afd356e982f.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32847'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32847</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-32846</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-17 23:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32846'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32846</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-32845</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-17 23:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the implementation of `qnotify` at `pci_vtrnd_notify` fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain`. This leads to `struct iovec iov;` being uninitialized and used to read memory in `len = (int) read(sc-&gt;vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len);` when an attacker is able to make `vq_getchain` fail. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit 41272a980197917df8e58ff90642d14dec8fe948.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32845'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32845</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-32815</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2021-08-09 18:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The assertion failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when modifying the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`. ### Patches The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5. ### References Regression test and bug fix: #1739 ### For more information Please see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information about Exiv2 security.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32815'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32815</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-32629</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2021-05-24 16:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Cranelift is an open-source code generator maintained by Bytecode Alliance. It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically: * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;s MSB. The issue would thus occur when: * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000; * The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the value&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;s definition and its use; * The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be &Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&Aring;&ldquo;special&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;? in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination: add, sub, mul, and, or; * The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program; * The resulting 64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable.
