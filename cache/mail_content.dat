<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28818</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 04:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup IT Analytics 11 before 11.2.0. The application upgrade process included unsigned files that could be exploited and result in a customer installing unauthentic components. A malicious actor could install rogue Collector executable files (aptare.jar or upgrademanager.zip) on the Portal server, which might then be downloaded and installed on collectors.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28818'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28818</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28686</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 04:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Dino before 0.2.3, 0.3.x before 0.3.2, and 0.4.x before 0.4.2 allows attackers to modify the personal bookmark store via a crafted message. The attacker can change the display of group chats or force a victim to join a group chat; the victim may then be tricked into disclosing sensitive information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28686'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28686</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28445</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. Resizable ArrayBuffers passed to asynchronous functions that are shrunk during the asynchronous operation could result in an out-of-bound read/write. It is unlikely that this has been exploited in the wild, as the only version affected is Deno 1.32.0. Deno Deploy users are not affected. The problem has been resolved by disabling resizable ArrayBuffers temporarily in Deno 1.32.1. Deno 1.32.2 will re-enable resizable ArrayBuffers with a proper fix. As a workaround, run with `--v8-flags=--no-harmony-rab-gsab` to disable resizable ArrayBuffers.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28445'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28445</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28443</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28443'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28443</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28442</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. Prior to versions 2.20.6, 2.19.6, and 2.18.7, anonymous users can obtain sensitive information about GeoNode configurations from the response of the `/geoserver/rest/about/status` Geoserver REST API endpoint. The Geoserver endpoint is secured by default, but the configuration of Geoserver for GeoNode opens a list of REST endpoints to support some of its public-facing services. The vulnerability impacts both GeoNode 3 and GeoNode 4 instances. Geoserver security configuration is provided by `geoserver-geonode-ext`. A patch for 2.20.7 has been released which blocks access to the affected endpoint. The patch has been backported to branches 2.20.6, 2.19.7, 2.19.6, and 2.18.7. All the published artifacts and Docker images have been updated accordingly. A more advanced patch has been applied to the master and development versions, which require some changes to GeoNode code. They will be available with the next 4.1.0 release. The patched configuration only has an effect on new deployments. For existing setups, the patch must be applied manually inside the Geoserver data directory. The patched file must replace the existing `<geoserver_datadir>/security/rest.properties` file.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28442'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28442</a>

In version 0.5.8 and prior, all persons who have failed login attempts will have their password stored in error logs. This problem doesn't occur in version 0.5.9. As a workaround, delete the affected log file, and ensure one logs in correctly.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28441'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28441</a>
