<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28846</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-30 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Unpoly is a JavaScript framework for server-side web applications. There is a possible Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the `unpoly-rails` gem that implements the Unpoly server protocol for Rails applications. This issues affects Rails applications that operate as an upstream of a load balancer's that uses passive health checks. The `unpoly-rails` gem echoes the request URL as an `X-Up-Location` response header. By making a request with exceedingly long URLs (paths or query string), an attacker can cause unpoly-rails to write a exceedingly large response header. If the response header is too large to be parsed by a load balancer downstream of the Rails application, it may cause the load balancer to remove the upstream from a load balancing group. This causes that application instance to become unavailable until a configured timeout is reached or until an active healthcheck succeeds. This issue has been fixed and released as version 2.7.2.2 which is available via RubyGems and GitHub. Users unable to upgrade may: Configure your load balancer to use active health checks, e.g. by periodically requesting a route with a known response that indicates healthiness; Configure your load balancer so the maximum size of response headers is at least twice the maximum size of a URL; or instead of changing your server configuration you may also configure your Rails application to delete redundant `X-Up-Location` headers set by unpoly-rails.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28846'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28846</a>

However, two SSH settings were omitted from the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-27538'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-27538</a>

This sharing was introduced without considerations for do this sharing across separate threads but there was no indication of this fact in the documentation. Due to missing mutexes or thread locks, two threads sharing the same HSTS data could end up doing a double-free or use-after-free.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-27537'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-27537</a>

This vulnerability affects krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-27536'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-27536</a>
