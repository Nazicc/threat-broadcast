<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28879</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-31 17:15:06 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In Artifex Ghostscript through 10.01.0, there is a buffer overflow leading to potential corruption of data internal to the PostScript interpreter, in base/sbcp.c. This affects BCPEncode, BCPDecode, TBCPEncode, and TBCPDecode. If the write buffer is filled to one byte less than full, and one then tries to write an escaped character, two bytes are written.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28879'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28879</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28877</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-31 17:15:06 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The VTEX apps-graphql@2.x GraphQL API module does not properly restrict unauthorized access to private configuration data. (apps-graphql@3.x is unaffected by this issue.)<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28877'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28877</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28846</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-30 20:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Unpoly is a JavaScript framework for server-side web applications. There is a possible Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the `unpoly-rails` gem that implements the Unpoly server protocol for Rails applications. This issues affects Rails applications that operate as an upstream of a load balancer's that uses passive health checks. The `unpoly-rails` gem echoes the request URL as an `X-Up-Location` response header. By making a request with exceedingly long URLs (paths or query string), an attacker can cause unpoly-rails to write a exceedingly large response header. If the response header is too large to be parsed by a load balancer downstream of the Rails application, it may cause the load balancer to remove the upstream from a load balancing group. This causes that application instance to become unavailable until a configured timeout is reached or until an active healthcheck succeeds. This issue has been fixed and released as version 2.7.2.2 which is available via RubyGems and GitHub. Users unable to upgrade may: Configure your load balancer to use active health checks, e.g. by periodically requesting a route with a known response that indicates healthiness; Configure your load balancer so the maximum size of response headers is at least twice the maximum size of a URL; or instead of changing your server configuration you may also configure your Rails application to delete redundant `X-Up-Location` headers set by unpoly-rails.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28846'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28846</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28845</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-31 23:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud talk is a video &amp; audio conferencing app for Nextcloud. In affected versions the talk app does not properly filter access to a conversations member list. As a result an attacker could use this vulnerability to gain information about the members of a Talk conversation, even if they themselves are not members. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk is upgraded to 14.0.9 or 15.0.4. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28845'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28845</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28844</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-31 23:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions users that should not be able to download a file can still download an older version and use that for uncontrolled distribution. This issue has been addressed in versions 24.0.10 and 25.0.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28844'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28844</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28843</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-31 18:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] PrestaShop/paypal is an open source module for the PrestaShop web commerce ecosystem which provides paypal payment support. A SQL injection vulnerability found in the PrestaShop paypal module from release from 3.12.0 to and including 3.16.3 allow a remote attacker to gain privileges, modify data, and potentially affect system availability. The cause of this issue is that SQL queries were being constructed with user input which had not been properly filtered. Only deployments on PrestaShop 1.6 are affected. Users are advised to upgrade to module version 3.16.4. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28843'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28843</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28835</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-30 19:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions the generated fallback password when creating a share was using a weak complexity random number generator, so when the sharer did not change it the password could be guessable to an attacker willing to brute force it. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. This issue only affects users who do not have a password policy enabled, so enabling a password policy is an effective mitigation for users unable to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28835'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28835</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28833</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-30 19:15:06 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions admins of a server were able to upload a logo or a favicon and to provided a file name which was not restricted and could overwrite files in the appdata directory. Administrators may have access to overwrite these files by other means but this method could be exploited by tricking an admin into uploading a maliciously named file. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting logo files from untrusted sources.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28833'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28833</a>
