<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-26049</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-11 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] This affects the package com.diffplug.gradle:goomph before 3.37.2. It allows a malicious zip file to potentially break out of the expected destination directory, writing contents into arbitrary locations on the file system. Overwriting certain files/directories could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution on a target system by exploiting this vulnerability. **Note:** This could have allowed a malicious zip file to extract itself into an arbitrary directory. The only file that Goomph extracts is the p2 bootstrapper and eclipse metadata files hosted at eclipse.org, which are not malicious, so the only way this vulnerability could have affected you is if you had set a custom bootstrap zip, and that zip was malicious.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26049'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26049</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-25295</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-11 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] This affects the package github.com/gophish/gophish before 0.12.0. The Open Redirect vulnerability exists in the next query parameter. The application uses url.Parse(r.FormValue("next")) to extract path and eventually redirect user to a relative URL, but if next parameter starts with multiple backslashes like \\\\\\example.com, browser will redirect user to http://example.com.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-25295'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-25295</a>
