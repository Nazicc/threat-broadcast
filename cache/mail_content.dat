<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40030</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-24 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Cargo downloads a Rust project’s dependencies and compiles the project. Starting in Rust 1.60.0 and prior to 1.72, Cargo did not escape Cargo feature names when including them in the report generated by `cargo build --timings`. A malicious package included as a dependency may inject nearly arbitrary HTML here, potentially leading to cross-site scripting if the report is subsequently uploaded somewhere. The vulnerability affects users relying on dependencies from git, local paths, or alternative registries. Users who solely depend on crates.io are unaffected.Rust 1.60.0 introduced `cargo build --timings`, which produces a report of how long the different steps of the build process took. It includes lists of Cargo features for each crate. Prior to Rust 1.72, Cargo feature names were allowed to contain almost any characters (with some exceptions as used by the feature syntax), but it would produce a future incompatibility warning about them since Rust 1.49. crates.io is far more stringent about what it considers a valid feature name and has not allowed such feature names. As the feature names were included unescaped in the timings report, they could be used to inject Javascript into the page, for example with a feature name like `features = ["<img src='' onerror=alert(0)"]`. If this report were subsequently uploaded to a domain that uses credentials, the injected Javascript could access resources from the website visitor.This issue was fixed in Rust 1.72 by turning the future incompatibility warning into an error. Users should still exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io has server-side checks preventing this attack, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to excercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40030'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40030</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40022</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-24 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. Versions 0.6.0 and prior are vulnerable to integer overflow in `consume_count` of `src/gnu_v2/cplus-dem.c`. The overflow check is valid logic but, is missing the modulus if the block once compiled. The compiler sees this block as unreachable code since the prior statement is multiplication by 10 and fails to consider overflow assuming the count will always be a multiple of 10. Rizin version 0.6.1 contains a fix for the issue. A temporary workaround would be disabling C++ demangling using the configuration option `bin.demangle=false`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40022'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40022</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40017</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-24 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts.

In Tuleap Community Edition prior to version 14.11.99.28 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition prior to versions 14.10-6 and 14.11-3, content displayed in the "card fields" (visible in the kanban and PV2 apps) is not properly escaped. An agile dashboard administrator deleting a kanban with a malicious label can be forced to execute uncontrolled code. Tuleap Community Edition 14.11.99.28, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.10-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.11-3 contain a fix for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-39521'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-39521</a>

In Tuleap Community Edition prior to version 14.11.99.28 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition prior to versions 14.10-6 and 14.11-3, the preview of an artifact link with a type does not respect the project, tracker and artifact level permissions. The issue occurs on the artifact view (not reproducible on the artifact modal). Users might get access to information they should not have access to. Only the title, status, assigned to and last update date fields as defined by the semantics are impacted. If those fields have strict permissions (e.g. the title is only visible to a specific user group) those permissions are still enforced. Tuleap Community Edition 14.11.99.28, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.10-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.11-3 contain a fix for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38508'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38508</a>

A Mass assignment vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 that allows a non-admin user to escalate privileges to those of an admin user. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32079'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32079</a>
