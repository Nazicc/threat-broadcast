<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41948</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-12-08 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture, management, validation, analytics and visualization. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A DHIS2 user with authority to manage users can assign superuser privileges to themself by manually crafting an HTTP PUT request. Only users with the following DHIS2 user role authorities can exploit this vulnerability. Note that in many systems the only users with user admin privileges are also superusers. In these cases, the escalation vulnerability does not exist. The vulnerability is only exploitable by attackers who can authenticate as users with the user admin authority. As this is usually a small and relatively trusted set of users, exploit vectors will often be limited. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1, 2.37.8.1, 2.38.2.1, 2.39.0.1. The only known workaround to this issue is to avoid the assignment of the user management authority to any users until the patch has been applied.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41948'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41948</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41947</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-12-08 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture, management, validation, analytics and visualization. Through various features of DHIS2, an authenticated user may be able to upload a file which includes embedded javascript. The user could then potentially trick another authenticated user to open the malicious file in a browser which would trigger the javascript code, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1, 2.37.8.1, 2.38.2.1, 2.39.0.1. Users unable to upgrade may add the following simple CSP rule in your web proxy to the vulnerable endpoints: `script-src 'none'`. This workaround will prevent all javascript from running on those endpoints.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41947'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41947</a>
