<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-32777</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2021-08-24 21:15:06 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions when ext-authz extension is sending request headers to the external authorization service it must merge multiple value headers according to the HTTP spec. However, only the last header value is sent. This may allow specifically crafted requests to bypass authorization. Attackers may be able to escalate privileges when using ext-authz extension or back end service that uses multiple value headers for authorization. A specifically constructed request may be delivered by an untrusted downstream peer in the presence of ext-authz extension. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to the ext-authz extension to correctly merge multiple request header values, when sending request for authorization.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32777'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32777</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-27786</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 17:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) enables browsers to perform cross domain requests in a controlled manner. This request has an Origin header that identifies the domain that is making the initial request and defines the protocol between a browser and server to see if the request is allowed. An attacker can take advantage of this and possibly carry out privileged actions and access sensitive information when the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is enabled.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27786'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27786</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-25116</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-13 13:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Enqueue Anything WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in the remove_asset AJAX action, and does not ensure that the item to be deleted is actually an asset. As a result, low privilege users such as subscriber could delete arbitrary assets, as well as put arbitrary posts in the trash.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-25116'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-25116</a>
