<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24248</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-12 12:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] RiteCMS version 3.1.0 and below suffers from an arbitrary file deletion via path traversal vulnerability in Admin Panel. Exploiting the vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to delete any file in the web root (along with any other file on the server that the PHP process user has the proper permissions to delete). Furthermore, an attacker might leverage the capability of arbitrary file deletion to circumvent certain web server security mechanisms such as deleting .htaccess file that would deactivate those security constraints.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24248'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24248</a>

Exploiting the vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite any file in the web root (along with any other file on the server that the PHP process user has the proper permissions to write) resulting a remote code execution.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24247'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24247</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-0878</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-12 12:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Electric Vehicle (EV) commonly utilises the Combined Charging System (CCS) for DC rapid charging. To exchange important messages such as the State of Charge (SoC) with the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) CCS uses a high-bandwidth IP link provided by the HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) power-line communication (PLC) technology. The attack interrupts necessary control communication between the vehicle and charger, causing charging sessions to abort. The attack can be conducted wirelessly from a distance using electromagnetic interference, allowing individual vehicles or entire fleets to be disrupted simultaneously. In addition, the attack can be mounted with off-the-shelf radio hardware and minimal technical knowledge. With a power budget of 1 W, the attack is successful from around 47 m distance. The exploited behavior is a required part of the HomePlug Green PHY, DIN 70121 & ISO 15118 standards and all known implementations exhibit it. In addition to electric cars, Brokenwire affects electric ships, airplanes and heavy duty vehicles utilising these standards.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-0878'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-0878</a>
