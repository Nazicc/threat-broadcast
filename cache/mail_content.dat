<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-0591</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-31 10:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ubireader_extract_files is vulnerable to path traversal when run against specifically crafted UBIFS files, allowing the attacker to overwrite files outside of the extraction directory (provided the process has write access to that file or directory). This is due to the fact that a node name (dent_node.name) is considered trusted and joined to the extraction directory path during processing, then the node content is written to that joined path. By crafting a malicious UBIFS file with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g. ../../tmp/outside.txt), it's possible to force ubi_reader to write outside of the extraction directory. This issue affects ubi-reader before 0.8.5.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0591'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0591</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-0587</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-01 03:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A file upload vulnerability in exists in Trend Micro Apex One server build 11110. Using a malformed Content-Length header in an HTTP PUT message sent to URL /officescan/console/html/cgi/fcgiOfcDDA.exe, an unauthenticated remote attacker can upload arbitrary files to the SampleSubmission directory (i.e., \PCCSRV\TEMP\SampleSubmission) on the server. The attacker can upload a large number of large files to fill up the file system on which the Apex One server is installed.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0587'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0587</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-0581</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-30 15:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The PrivateContent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to protection mechanism bypass due to the use of client side validation in versions up to, and including, 8.4.3. This is due to the plugin checking if an IP had been blocklist via client-side scripts rather than server-side. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any login restrictions that may prevent a brute force attack.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0581'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0581</a>
