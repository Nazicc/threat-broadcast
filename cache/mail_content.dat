The issue can also be reproduced by inserting the dangerous payload in the `height` or `alt` macro properties. This has been patched in versions 13.10.7, 14.4.2, and 14.5. The issue can be fixed on a running wiki by updating `XWiki.AttachmentSelector` with the versions below: - 14.5-rc-1+: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/eb15147adf94bddb92626f862c1710d45bcd64a7#diff-e1513599ab698991f6cbba55d38f3f464432ced8d137a668b1f7618c7e747e23 - 14.4.2+: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/c02f8eb1f3c953d124f2c097021536f8bc00fa8d#diff-e1513599ab698991f6cbba55d38f3f464432ced8d137a668b1f7618c7e747e23 - 13.10.7+: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/efd0df0468d46149ba68b66660b93f31b6318515#diff-e1513599ab698991f6cbba55d38f3f464432ced8d137a668b1f7618c7e747e23<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41928'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41928</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41927</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 19:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) that may allow attackers to delete or rename tags without needing any confirmation. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.4.1 and 14.5RC1. Workarounds: It's possible to patch existing instances directly by editing the page Main.Tags and add this kind of check, in the code for renaming and for deleting: ``` #if (!$services.csrf.isTokenValid($request.get('form_token'))) #set ($discard = $response.sendError(401, &quot;Wrong CSRF token&quot;)) #end ```<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41927'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41927</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41926</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-25 19:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcould talk android is the android OS implementation of the nextcloud talk chat system. In affected versions the receiver is not protected by broadcastPermission allowing malicious apps to monitor communication. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk Android is upgraded to 14.1.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41926'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41926</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41925</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 19:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale client allows a malicious website to access the peer API, which can then be used to access Tailscale environment variables. In the Tailscale client, the peer API was vulnerable to DNS rebinding. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in the client, including accessing the node&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Tailscale environment variables. An attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use that access to read the node&acirc;&euro;&trade;s environment variables, including any credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add new nodes to the user&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tailnet. The peer API access could also be used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via Taildrop. All Tailscale clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected. Upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41925'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41925</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41924</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 19:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon `tailscaled`, which can then be used to remotely execute code. In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server. An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node. All Windows clients prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected. If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41924'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41924</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41923</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 19:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x &gt;=3.0.0 &lt;3.3.2 &gt;=4.0.0 &lt;4.0.5 &gt;=5.0.0 &lt;5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41923'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41923</a>

Prior to version 2.9.0.beta13, users can post chat messages of an unlimited length, which can cause a denial of service for other users when posting huge amounts of text. Users should upgrade to version 2.9.0.beta13, where a limit has been introduced.
