<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-35897</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-21 17:15:25 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An stack buffer overflow vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. If the attacker modifies specific UEFI variables, it can cause a stack overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution. The specific variables are normally locked (read-only) at the OS level and therefore an attack would require direct SPI modification. If an attacker can change the values of at least two variables out of three (SecureBootEnforce, SecureBoot, RestoreBootSettings), it is possible to execute arbitrary code.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-35897'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-35897</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-3589</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-21 10:15:31 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An API Endpoint used by Miele's &quot;AppWash&quot; MobileApp in all versions was vulnerable to an authorization bypass. A low privileged, remote attacker would have been able to gain read and partial write access to other users data by modifying a small part of a HTTP request sent to the API. Reading or changing the password of another user was not possible, thus no impact to Availability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3589'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3589</a>
