<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40195</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-28 08:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Airflow Spark Provider.When the Apache Spark provider is installed on an Airflow deployment, an Airflow user that is authorized to configure Spark hooks can effectively run arbitrary code on the Airflow node by pointing it at a malicious Spark server. Prior to version 4.1.3, this was not called out in the documentation explicitly, so it is possible that administrators provided authorizations to configure Spark hooks without taking this into account. We recommend administrators to review their configurations to make sure the authorization to configure Spark hooks is only provided to fully trusted users.To view the warning in the docs please visit  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark/4.1.3/connections/spark.html<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40195'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40195</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-27604</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-28 08:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Apache Airflow Sqoop Provider, versions before 4.0.0, is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker pass parameters with the connections, which makes it possible to implement RCE attacks via ‘sqoop import --connect’, obtain airflow server permissions, etc. The attacker needs to be logged in and have authorization (permissions) to create/edit connections. It is recommended to upgrade to a version that is not affected.This issue was reported independently by happyhacking-k, And Xie Jianming and LiuHui of Caiji Sec Team also reported it.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-27604'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-27604</a>
