<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-41037</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-08 04:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In Eclipse p2, installable units are able to alter the Eclipse Platform installation and the local machine via touchpoints during installation. Those touchpoints can, for example, alter the command-line used to start the application, injecting things like agent or other settings that usually require particular attention in term of security. Although p2 has built-in strategies to ensure artifacts are signed and then to help establish trust, there is no such strategy for the metadata part that does configure such touchpoints. As a result, it's possible to install a unit that will run malicious code during installation without user receiving any warning about this installation step being risky when coming from untrusted source.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-41037'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-41037</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-1245</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-08 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A privilege escalation flaw was found in the token exchange feature of keycloak. Missing authorization allows a client application holding a valid access token to exchange tokens for any target client by passing the client_id of the target. This could allow a client to gain unauthorized access to additional services.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-1245'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-1245</a>
