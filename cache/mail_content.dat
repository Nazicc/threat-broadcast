<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-45866</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] qpress before PierreLvx/qpress 20220819 and before version 11.3, as used in Percona XtraBackup and other products, allows directory traversal via ../ in a .qp file.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-45866'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-45866</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-44140</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Jizhicms v2.3.3 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the /Member/memberedit.html component.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-44140'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-44140</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41946</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. In affected versions a prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.0. Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will mitigate this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41946'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41946</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41935</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Users without the right to view documents can deduce their existence by repeated Livetable queries. The issue has been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 13.10.8, and 14.4.3, the response is not properly cleaned up of obfuscated entries. As a workaround, The patch for the document `XWiki.LiveTableResultsMacros` can be manually applied or a XAR archive of a patched version can be imported, on versions 12.10.11, 13.9-rc-1, and 13.4.4. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41935'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41935</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41934</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the menu macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation due to improper escaping of the macro content and parameters of the menu macro. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 13.10.8 and 14.4.3. The patch (commit `2fc20891`) for the document `Menu.MenuMacro` can be manually applied or a XAR archive of a patched version can be imported. The menu macro was basically unchanged since XWiki 11.6 so on XWiki 11.6 or later the patch for version of 13.10.8 (commit `59ccca24a`) can most likely be applied, on XWiki version 14.0 and later the versions in XWiki 14.6 and 14.4.3 should be appropriate.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41934'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41934</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41931</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] xwiki-platform-icon-ui is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection'). Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the icon picker macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki due to improper neutralization of the macro parameters of the icon picker macro. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.5 and 14.4.2. Workarounds: The [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/47eb8a5fba550f477944eb6da8ca91b87eaf1d01) can be manually applied by editing `IconThemesCode.IconPickerMacro` in the object editor. The whole document can also be replaced by the current version by importing the document from the XAR archive of a fixed version as the only changes to the document have been security fixes and small formatting changes.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41931'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41931</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41930</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-23 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-user-profile-ui is missing authorization to enable or disable users. Any user (logged in or not) with access to the page XWiki.XWikiUserProfileSheet can enable or disable any user profile. This might allow to a disabled user to re-enable themselves, or to an attacker to disable any user of the wiki. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.5RC1 and 14.4.2. Workarounds: The problem can be patched immediately by editing the page `XWiki.XWikiUserProfileSheet` in the wiki and by performing the changes contained in https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5be1cc0adf917bf10899c47723fa451e950271fa.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41930'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41930</a>

This operation is meant to only be available for users with admin rights. This problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.4.2 and 14.5RC1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41929'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41929</a>
