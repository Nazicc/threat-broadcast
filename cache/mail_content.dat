<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-3787</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-20 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Codecanyon Tiva Events Calender 1.4. This vulnerability affects unknown code. The manipulation of the argument name leads to cross site scripting. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-235054 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3787'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3787</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34968</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-20 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A path disclosure vulnerability was found in Samba. As part of the Spotlight protocol, Samba discloses the server-side absolute path of shares, files, and directories in the results for search queries. This flaw allows a malicious client or an attacker with a targeted RPC request to view the information that is part of the disclosed path.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34968'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34968</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34967</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-20 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the mdssvc protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with a key, a caller may trigger a crash in talloc_get_size() when talloc detects that the passed-in pointer is not a valid talloc pointer. With an RPC worker process shared among multiple client connections, a malicious client or attacker can trigger a process crash in a shared RPC mdssvc worker process, affecting all other clients this worker serves.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34967'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34967</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34966</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-20 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An infinite loop vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets sent by the client, the core unmarshalling function sl_unpack_loop() did not validate a field in the network packet that contains the count of elements in an array-like structure. By passing 0 as the count value, the attacked function will run in an endless loop consuming 100% CPU. This flaw allows an attacker to issue a malformed RPC request, triggering an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service condition.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34966'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34966</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-3347</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-20 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in Samba's SMB2 packet signing mechanism. The SMB2 packet signing is not enforced if an admin configured "server signing = required" or for SMB2 connections to Domain Controllers where SMB2 packet signing is mandatory. This flaw allows an attacker to perform attacks, such as a man-in-the-middle attack, by intercepting the network traffic and modifying the SMB2 messages between client and server, affecting the integrity of the data.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3347'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3347</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-2127</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-20 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in Samba due to insufficient length checks in winbindd_pam_auth_crap.c. When performing NTLM authentication, the client replies to cryptographic challenges back to the server. These replies have variable lengths, and Winbind fails to check the lan manager response length. When Winbind is used for NTLM authentication, a maliciously crafted request can trigger an out-of-bounds read in Winbind, possibly resulting in a crash.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-2127'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-2127</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32476</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-20 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Dell Hybrid Client version 2.0 contains a Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability. An unauthenticated malicious user on the device can access hard coded secrets in javascript files.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32476'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32476</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32265</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-20 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A potential security vulnerability has been identified in the Enterprise Server Common Web Administration (ESCWA) component used in Enterprise Server, Enterprise Test Server, Enterprise Developer, Visual COBOL, and COBOL Server.An attacker would need to be authenticated into ESCWA to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. As described in the hardening guide in the product documentation, other mitigations including restricting network access to ESCWA and restricting usersâ€™ permissions in the Micro Focus Directory Server also reduce the exposure to this issue.Given the right conditions this vulnerability could be exploited to expose a service account password. The account corresponding to the exposed credentials usually has limited privileges and, in many cases would only be useful for extracting details of other user accounts and similar information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32265'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32265</a>
