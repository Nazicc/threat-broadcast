<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31006</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-09 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack.This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31006'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31006</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36109</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-09 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `"USER $USERNAME"` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT ["su", "-", "user"]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36109'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36109</a>

The next chunk is then freed later on, causing a freeing of an arbitrary amount of memory.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-40648'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-40648</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-40647</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-09 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In man2html 1.6g, a specific string being read in from a file will overwrite the size parameter in the top chunk of the heap. This at least causes the program to segmentation abort if the heap size parameter isn't aligned correctly. In version before GLIBC version 2.29 and aligned correctly, it allows arbitrary write anywhere in the programs memory.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-40647'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-40647</a>
