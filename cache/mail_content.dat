<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-2717</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-20 03:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'enable_safe_mode' function.

A warning message about safe mode is displayed to the admin, which can be easily disabled.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2717'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2717</a>
