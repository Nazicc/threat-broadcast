<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-44392</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-09 20:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44392'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44392</a>

Continued receipt and processing of telemetry requests will repeatedly crash the jkdsd process and sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue is seen on all Junos platforms. The crash is triggered when multiple telemetry requests come from different collectors. As the load increases, the Dynamic Rendering Daemon (drend) decides to defer processing and continue later, which results in a timing issue accessing stale memory, causing the jkdsd process to crash and restart.This issue affects:Juniper Networks Junos OS:  *  20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S9;  *  21.1 versions 21.1R1 and later;  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6;  *  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5;  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S5;  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4;  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2;  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S1, 22.3R3-S1;  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3;  *  23.1 versions prior to 23.1R2;  *  23.2 versions prior to 23.2R2.This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 19.4R1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44188'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44188</a>
