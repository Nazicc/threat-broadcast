<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28435</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Dataease is an open source data visualization and analysis tool. The permissions for the file upload interface is not checked so users who are not logged in can upload directly to the background. The file type also goes unchecked, users could upload any type of file. These vulnerabilities has been fixed in version 1.18.5.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28435'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28435</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28448</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Versionize is a framework for version tolerant serializion/deserialization of Rust data structures, designed for usecases that need fast deserialization times and minimal size overhead. An issue was discovered in the ‘Versionize::deserialize’ implementation provided by the ‘versionize’ crate for ‘vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper', which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The impact started with version 0.1.1. The issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28448'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28448</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28446</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. Arbitrary program names without any ANSI filtering allows any malicious program to clear the first 2 lines of a `op_spawn_child` or `op_kill` prompt and replace it with any desired text. This works with any command on the respective platform, giving the program the full ability to choose what program they wanted to run. This problem can not be exploited on systems that do not attach an interactive prompt (for example headless servers). This issue has been patched in version 1.31.2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28446'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28446</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28444</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-24 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] angular-server-side-configuration helps configure an angular application at runtime on the server or in a docker container via environment variables. angular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory. During deployment of an Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file). With version 15.0.0 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and exposed via index.html. This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project that has no backend component. This vulnerability has been mitigated in version 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default. As a workaround, manually edit or create ngssc.json or run script after ngssc.json generation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28444'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28444</a>
