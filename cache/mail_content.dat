<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32348</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-22 16:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Teltonika&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain a virtual private network (VPN) hub feature for cross-device communication that uses OpenVPN. It connects new devices in a manner that allows the new device to communicate with all Teltonika devices connected to the VPN. The OpenVPN server also allows users to route through it. An attacker could route a connection to a remote server through the OpenVPN server, enabling them to scan and access data from other Teltonika devices connected to the VPN.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32348'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32348</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32347</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-22 15:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Teltonika&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 use device serial numbers and MAC addresses to identify devices from the user perspective for device claiming and from the device perspective for authentication. If an attacker obtained the serial number and MAC address of a device, they could authenticate as that device and steal communication credentials of the device. This could allow an attacker to enable arbitrary command execution as root by utilizing management options within the newly registered devices.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32347'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32347</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32346</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-22 15:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Teltonika&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain a function that allows users to claim their devices. This function returns information based on whether the serial number of a device has already been claimed, the MAC address of a device has already been claimed, or whether the attempt to claim a device was successful. An attacker could exploit this to create a list of the serial numbers and MAC addresses of all devices cloud-connected to the Remote Management System.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32346'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32346</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32325</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-27 00:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] PostHog-js is a library to interface with the PostHog analytics tool. Versions prior to 1.57.2 have the potential for cross-site scripting. Problem has been patched in 1.57.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that their Content Security Policy is in place.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32325'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32325</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32321</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-26 23:15:18 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals. Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ckan which may lead to remote code execution. An arbitrary file write in `resource_create` and `package_update` actions, using the `ResourceUploader` object.  Also reachable via `package_create`, `package_revise`, and `package_patch` via calls to `package_update`. Remote code execution via unsafe pickle loading, via Beaker's session store when configured to use the file session store backend. Potential DOS due to lack of a length check on the resource id. Information disclosure: A user with permission to create a resource can access any other resource on the system if they know the id, even if they don't have access to it. Resource overwrite: A user with permission to create a resource can overwrite any resource if they know the id, even if they don't have access to it. A user with permissions to create or edit a dataset can upload a resource with a specially crafted id to write the uploaded file in an arbitrary location. This can be leveraged to Remote Code Execution via Beaker's insecure pickle loading. All the above listed vulnerabilities have been fixed in CKAN 2.9.9 and CKAN 2.10.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32321'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32321</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32319</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-26 23:15:17 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud server is an open source personal cloud implementation. Missing brute-force protection on the WebDAV endpoints via the basic auth header allowed to brute-force user credentials when the provided user name was not an email address. Users from version 24.0.0 onward are affected. This issue has been addressed in releases 24.0.11, 25.0.5 and 26.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32319'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32319</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32317</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-26 23:15:16 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the MOSS cheat checker functionality of Autolab. To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Both &quot;Base File Tar&quot; and &quot;Additional file archive&quot; can be fed with Tar files that contain paths outside their target directories (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped2.sh`). When the MOSS cheat checker is started the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write within the scope of the running process.  This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32317'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32317</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32316</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-26 23:15:16 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] CloudExplorer Lite is an open source cloud management tool. In affected versions users can add themselves to any organization in CloudExplorer Lite. This is due to a missing permission check on the user profile. It is recommended to upgrade the version to v1.1.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32316'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32316</a>
