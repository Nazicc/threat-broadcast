Starting in version 3.5-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1, the mail obfuscation configuration was not fully taken into account. While the mail displayed to the end user was obfuscated, the rest response was also containing the mail unobfuscated and users were able to filter and sort on the unobfuscated, allowing them to infer the mail content. The consequence was the possibility to retrieve the email addresses of all users even when obfuscated. This has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34467'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34467</a>

Starting in version 5.0-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1, tags from pages not viewable to the current user are leaked by the tags API. This information can also be exploited to infer the document reference of non-viewable pages. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34466'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34466</a>

Starting in version 11.8-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.6, and 15.2, `Mail.MailConfig` can be edited by any logged-in user by default. Consequently, they can change the mail obfuscation configuration and view and edit the mail sending configuration, including the smtp domain name and credentials. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.6, and 15.1. As a workaround, the rights of the `Mail.MailConfig` page can be manually updated so that only a set of trusted users can view, edit and delete it (e.g., the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34465'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34465</a>
