<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-38176</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in YSoft SAFEQ 6 before 6.0.72. Incorrect privileges were configured as part of the installer package for the Client V3 services, allowing for local user privilege escalation by overwriting the executable file via an alternative data stream.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36072</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] SilverwareGames.io is a social network for users to play video games online. In version 1.1.8 and prior, due to an unobvious feature of PHP, hashes generated by built-in functions and starting with the `0e` symbols were being handled as zero multiplied with the `e` number. Therefore, the hash value was equal to 0. The maintainers fixed this in version 1.1.9 by using `===` instead of `==` in comparisons where it is possible (e.g. on sign in/sign up handlers).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36072'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36072</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36065</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container.  If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36065'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36065</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36064</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability impacts users that use Shescape to escape arguments for the Unix shells `Bash` and `Dash`, or any not-officially-supported Unix shell; and/or using the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. An attacker can cause polynomial backtracking or quadratic runtime in terms of the input string length due to two Regular Expressions in Shescape that are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This bug has been patched in v1.5.10. For `Dash` only, this bug has been patched since v1.5.9. As a workaround, a maximum length can be enforced on input strings to Shescape to reduce the impact of the vulnerability. It is not recommended to try and detect vulnerable input strings, as the logic for this may end up being vulnerable to ReDoS itself.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36064'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36064</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36061</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Elrond go is the go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol. In versions prior to 1.3.35, read only calls between contracts can generate smart contracts results. For example, if contract A calls in read only mode contract B and the called function will make changes upon the contract's B state, the state will be altered for contract B as if the call was not made in the read-only mode. This can lead to some effects not designed by the original smart contracts programmers. This issue was patched in version 1.3.35. There are no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36061'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36061</a>
