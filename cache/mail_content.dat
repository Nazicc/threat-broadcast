<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22412</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-13 00:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An Improper Locking vulnerability in the SIP ALG of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC or MS-MIC card and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a flow processing daemon (flowd) crash and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt of these specific packets will cause a sustained Denial of Service condition. This issue occurs when SIP ALG is enabled and specific SIP messages are processed simultaneously. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 20.4R1 on MX Series, or SRX Series.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22412'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22412</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22411</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-13 00:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability in Flow Processing Daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS). On SRX Series devices using Unified Policies with IPv6, when a specific IPv6 packet goes through a dynamic-application filter which will generate an ICMP deny message, the flowd core is observed and the PFE is restarted. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S4; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22411'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22411</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22409</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-13 00:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An Unchecked Input for Loop Condition vulnerability in a NAT library of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When an inconsistent &quot;deterministic NAT&quot; configuration is present on an SRX, or MX with SPC3 and then a specific CLI command is issued the SPC will crash and restart. Repeated execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS. Such a configuration is characterized by the total number of port blocks being greater than the total number of hosts. An example for such configuration is: [ services nat source pool TEST-POOL address x.x.x.0/32 to x.x.x.15/32 ] [ services nat source pool TEST-POOL port deterministic block-size 1008 ] [ services nat source pool TEST-POOL port deterministic host address y.y.y.0/24] [ services nat source pool TEST-POOL port deterministic include-boundary-addresses] where according to the following calculation: 65536-1024=64512 (number of usable ports per IP address, implicit) 64512/1008=64 (number of port blocks per Nat IP) x.x.x.0/32 to x.x.x.15/32 = 16 (NAT IP addresses available in NAT pool) total port blocks in NAT Pool = 64 blocks per IP * 16 IPs = 1024 Port blocks host address y.y.y.0/24 = 256 hosts (with include-boundary-addresses) If the port block size is configured to be 4032, then the total port blocks are (64512/4032) * 16 = 256 which is equivalent to the total host addresses of 256, and the issue will not be seen. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series, and MX Series with SPC3: All versions prior to 19.4R3-S10; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S6; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S6; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S1; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2-S2, 22.1R3; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22409'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22409</a>

When an attacker sends an SIP packets with a malformed SDP field then the SIP ALG can not process it which will lead to an FPC crash and restart. Continued receipt of these specific packets will lead to a sustained Denial of Service. This issue can only occur when both below mentioned conditions are fulfilled: 1. Call distribution needs to be enabled: [security alg sip enable-call-distribution] 2. The SIP ALG needs to be enabled, either implicitly / by default or by way of configuration. To confirm whether SIP ALG is enabled on SRX, and MX with SPC3 use the following command: user@host&gt; show security alg status | match sip SIP : Enabled This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX 5000 Series: 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S2; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2-S2, 22.1R3; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3; 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R1-S1, 22.3R2.

In a segment-routing scenario with OSPF as IGP, when a peer interface continuously flaps, next-hop churn will happen and a continuous increase in Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) memory consumption will be observed. This will eventually lead to an rpd crash and restart when the memory is full. The memory consumption can be monitored using the CLI command &quot;show task memory detail&quot; as shown in the following example: user@host&gt; show task memory detail | match &quot;RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE|RT_TEMPLATE_BOOK_KEE&quot; RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 1008 1024 T 50 51200 50 51200 RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 688 768 T 50 38400 50 38400 RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 368 384 T 412330 158334720 412330 158334720 RT_TEMPLATE_BOOK_KEE 2064 2560 T 33315 85286400 33315 85286400 user@host&gt; show task memory detail | match &quot;RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE|RT_TEMPLATE_BOOK_KEE&quot; RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 1008 1024 T 50 51200 50 51200 RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 688 768 T 50 38400 50 38400 RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 368 384 T 419005 160897920 419005 160897920 &lt;=== RT_TEMPLATE_BOOK_KEE 2064 2560 T 39975 102336000 39975 10233600 &lt;=== This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions prior to 19.3R3-S7; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S8, 19.4R3-S9; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S1, 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2.
