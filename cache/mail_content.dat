These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation. Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a device associated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regions need to remain continuouly accessible by the device. This requirement has been violated. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device may have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26361'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26361</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-26357</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-05 13:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] race in VT-d domain ID cleanup Xen domain IDs are up to 15 bits wide. VT-d hardware may allow for only less than 15 bits to hold a domain ID associating a physical device with a particular domain. Therefore internally Xen domain IDs are mapped to the smaller value range. The cleaning up of the housekeeping structures has a race, allowing for VT-d domain IDs to be leaked and flushes to be bypassed.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26357'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26357</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-26356</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-05 13:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26356'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26356</a>
