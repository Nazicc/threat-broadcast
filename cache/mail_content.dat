Under certain conditions, a user badge may have been awarded based on a user's activity in a topic with restricted access. Before this vulnerability was disclosed, the topic title of the topic associated with the user badge may be viewed by any user. If there are sensitive information in the topic title, it will therefore have been exposed. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. There are currently no known workarounds available.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39378'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39378</a>

Users who receive an invitation link that is not scoped to a single email address can enter any non-admin user's email and gain access to their account when accepting the invitation. All users should upgrade to the latest version. A workaround is temporarily disabling invitations with `SiteSetting.max_invites_per_day = 0` or scope them to individual email addresses.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39356'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39356</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-39353</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-02 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] xmldom is a pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) `DOMParser` and `XMLSerializer` module. xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without reporting any error or throwing. This breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node in the tree, which led to issuance of CVE-2022-39299 as it is a potential issue for dependents. Update to @xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7, @xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4 (dist-tag latest) or @xmldom/xmldom@>=0.9.0-beta.4 (dist-tag next). As a workaround, please one of the following approaches depending on your use case: instead of searching for elements in the whole DOM, only search in the `documentElement`or reject a document with a document that has more then 1 `childNode`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39353'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39353</a>

A malicious admin could use this vulnerability to perform port enumeration on the local host or other hosts on the internal network, as well as against hosts on the Internet. Latest `stable`, `beta`, and `test-passed` versions are now patched. As a workaround, self-hosters can use `DISCOURSE_BLOCKED_IP_BLOCKS` env var (which overrides `blocked_ip_blocks` setting) to stop webhooks from accessing private IPs.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39241'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39241</a>

In syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" sets the variables "A=B" and "C=D".<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41716'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-41716</a>

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-45448'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-45448</a>
