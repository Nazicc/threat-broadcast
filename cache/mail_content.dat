The Web Application is affected by Broken Access Control. It does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality under the /mngset/authset path.

This is possible because SWG incorrectly creates a HTTP redirect response when a user clicks a carefully constructed URL. Following the redirect response, the new request is still filtered by the SWG policy.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-1254'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-1254</a>
