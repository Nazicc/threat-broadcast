<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-5054</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-19 07:15:51 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Super Store Finder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary email creation and relay in versions up to, and including, 6.9.2. This is due to insufficient restrictions on the sendMail.php file that allows direct access. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails utilizing the vulnerable site's server, with arbitrary content. Please note that this vulnerability has already been publicly disclosed with an exploit which is why we are publishing the details without a patch available, we are attempting to initiate contact with the developer.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-5054'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-5054</a>

In versions 1.0.0 and prior, on the People Page of LMS, there was an SQL Injection vulnerability. The issue has been fixed in the `main` branch. Users won't face this issue if they are using the latest main branch of the app.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42807'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42807</a>

Prior to version 0.13.0, not signing and verifying `$\mathsf{cid}$` allows an attacker (which must be a participant of this head) to use a snapshot from an old head instance with the same participants to close the head or contest the state with it. This can lead to an incorrect distribution of value (= value extraction attack; hard, but possible) or prevent the head to finalize because the value available is not consistent with the closed utxo state (= denial of service; easy). A patch is planned for version 0.13.0. As a workaround, rotate keys between heads so not to re-use keys and not result in the same multi-signature participants.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42806'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42806</a>

Prior to versions 0.9.5 and 0.10.5, receiving unknown QUIC frames in a QUIC packet could result in a panic. The problem has been fixed in 0.9.5 and 0.10.5 maintenance releases.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42805'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42805</a>

Prior to versions 4.8.10 and 5.8.5, there is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability for SVG images. Note that an image tag with an SVG image as source is never vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to upload an image, and then trick a user into following a specially crafted link. Patches are available in Zope 4.8.10 and 5.8.5. As a workaround, make sure the "Add Documents, Images, and Files" permission is only assigned to trusted roles. By default, only the Manager has this permission.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42458'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42458</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-42456</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-21 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Sudo-rs, a memory safe implementation of sudo and su, allows users to not have to enter authentication at every sudo attempt, but instead only requiring authentication every once in a while in every terminal or process group. Only once a configurable timeout has passed will the user have to re-authenticate themselves. Supporting this functionality is a set of session files (timestamps) for each user, stored in `/var/run/sudo-rs/ts`. These files are named according to the username from which the sudo attempt is made (the origin user). An issue was discovered in versions prior to 0.2.1 where usernames containing the `.` and `/` characters could result in the corruption of specific files on the filesystem. As usernames are generally not limited by the characters they can contain, a username appearing to be a relative path can be constructed. For example we could add a user to the system containing the username `../../../../bin/cp`. When logged in as a user with that name, that user could run `sudo -K` to clear their session record file. The session code then constructs the path to the session file by concatenating the username to the session file storage directory, resulting in a resolved path of `/bin/cp`. The code then clears that file, resulting in the `cp` binary effectively being removed from the system. An attacker needs to be able to login as a user with a constructed username. Given that such a username is unlikely to exist on an existing system, they will also need to be able to create the users with the constructed usernames. The issue is patched in version 0.2.1 of sudo-rs. Sudo-rs now uses the uid for the user instead of their username for determining the filename. Note that an upgrade to this version will result in existing session files being ignored and users will be forced to re-authenticate. It also fully eliminates any possibility of path traversal, given that uids are always integer values. The `sudo -K` and `sudo -k` commands can run, even if a user has no sudo access. As a workaround, make sure that one's system does not contain any users with a specially crafted username. While this is the case and while untrusted users do not have the ability to create arbitrary users on the system, one should not be able to exploit this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42456'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42456</a>

Starting in the 2.x branch and prior to versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1, when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer, making the server less responsive. Patches are available in `plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1. Series 1.x is not affected. As a workaround, one may redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++` in one's frontend web server (nginx, Apache).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42457'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42457</a>

Prior to versions 5.6.1, 6.0.3, 6.1.3, and 6.2.1, there is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability for SVG images. A security hotfix from 2021 already partially fixed this by making sure SVG images are always downloaded instead of shown inline. But the same problem still exists for scales of SVG images. Note that an image tag with an SVG image as source is not vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to upload an image, and then trick a user into following a specially crafted link. Patches are available in versions 5.6.1 (for Plone 5.2), 6.0.3 (for Plone 6.0.0-6.0.4), 6.1.3 (for Plone 6.0.5-6.0.6), and 6.2.1 (for Plone 6.0.7). There are no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-41048'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-41048</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40183</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-21 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] DataEase is an open source data visualization and analysis tool. Prior to version 1.18.11, DataEase has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to to obtain user cookies. The program only uses the `ImageIO.read()` method to determine whether the file is an image file or not. There is no whitelisting restriction on file suffixes. This allows the attacker to synthesize the attack code into an image for uploading and change the file extension to html. The attacker may steal user cookies by accessing links. The vulnerability has been fixed in v1.18.11. There are no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40183'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40183</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-43637</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-21 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Due to the implementation of "deriveVaultKey", prior to version 7.10, the generated vault key would always have the last 16 bytes predetermined to be "arfoobarfoobarfo". This issue happens because "deriveVaultKey" calls "retrieveCloudKey" (which will always return "foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo" as the key), and then merges the 32byte randomly generated key with this key (by takeing 16bytes from each, see "mergeKeys"). This makes the key a lot weaker. This issue does not persist in devices that were initialized on/after version 7.10, but devices that were initialized before that and updated to a newer version still have this issue. Roll an update that enforces the full 32bytes key usage.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-43637'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-43637</a>
