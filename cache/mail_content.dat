<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20782</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of administrative privilege levels for high-value sensitive data. An attacker with read-only Administrator privileges to the web-based management interface on an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information regarding the configuration of the system.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20782'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20782</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20781</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20781'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20781</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20774</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against a user of the web-based interface of an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform configuration changes on the affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20774'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20774</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20763</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the login authorization components of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary Java code. This vulnerability is due to improper deserialization of Java code within login requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious login requests to the Cisco Webex Meetings service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary Java code and take arbitrary actions within the Cisco Webex Meetings application.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20763'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20763</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20762</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the Common Execution Environment (CEE) ConfD CLI of Cisco Ultra Cloud Core - Subscriber Microservices Infrastructure (SMI) software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control in the affected CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as a CEE ConfD CLI user and executing a specific CLI command. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access privileged containers with root privileges.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20762'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20762</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20756</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the RADIUS feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing RADIUS packets. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to a network or a service where the access server is using Cisco ISE as the RADIUS server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco ISE to stop processing RADIUS requests, causing authentication/authorization timeouts, which would then result in legitimate requests being denied access. Note: To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets, a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) is required.
