<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33178</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-30 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Xibo is a content management system (CMS). An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the `/dataset/data/{id}` API route inside the CMS starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to versions 2.3.17 and 3.3.5. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the `filter` parameter. Values allowed in the filter parameter are checked against a deny list of commands that should not be allowed, however this checking was done in a case sensitive manor and so it is possible to bypass these checks by using unusual case combinations. Users should upgrade to version 2.3.17 or 3.3.5, which fix this issue. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33178'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33178</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33177</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-30 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Xibo is a content management system (CMS). A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Xibo CMS whereby a specially crafted zip file can be uploaded to the CMS via the layout import function by an authenticated user which would allow creation of files outside of the CMS library directory as the webserver user. This can be used to upload a PHP webshell inside the web root directory and achieve remote code execution as the webserver user. Users should upgrade to version 2.3.17 or 3.3.5, which fix this issue. Customers who host their CMS with Xibo Signage have already received an upgrade or patch to resolve this issue regardless of the CMS version that they are running.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33177'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33177</a>
