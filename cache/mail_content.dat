<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29222</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-21 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security. Prior to version 2.1.5, a DTLS Client could provide a Certificate that it doesn't posses the private key for and Pion DTLS wouldn't reject it. This issue affects users that are using Client certificates only. The connection itself is still secure. The Certificate provided by clients can't be trusted when using a Pion DTLS server prior to version 2.1.5. Users should upgrade to version 2.1.5 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29222'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29222</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29216</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-21 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29216'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29216</a>

Versions prior to 1.1.0 contain a YAML injection vulnerability that can cause an instant server crash if the passed arguments are not matched. Version 1.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, restrict operator permissions to untrusted people and avoid entering arguments likely to cause a crash.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29215'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29215</a>

Prior to versions 3.29.3 and 4.3.3, an open redirect vulnerability is present when the developer is implementing an OAuth 1 provider. Versions 3.29.3 and 4.3.3 contain a patch for this issue. The maintainers recommend adding a certain configuration to one's `callbacks` option as a workaround for those unable to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29214'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29214</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29213</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-21 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the `tf.compat.v1.signal.rfft2d` and `tf.compat.v1.signal.rfft3d` lack input validation and under certain condition can result in crashes (due to `CHECK`-failures). Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29213'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29213</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29212</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-21 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29212'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29212</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29211</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-21 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.histogram_fixed_width` is vulnerable to a crash when the values array contain `Not a Number` (`NaN`) elements. The implementation assumes that all floating point operations are defined and then converts a floating point result to an integer index. If `values` contains `NaN` then the result of the division is still `NaN` and the cast to `int32` would result in a crash. This only occurs on the CPU implementation. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29211'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29211</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29210</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-21 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29210'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29210</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29209</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-21 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the macros that TensorFlow uses for writing assertions (e.g., `CHECK_LT`, `CHECK_GT`, etc.) have an incorrect logic when comparing `size_t` and `int` values. Due to type conversion rules, several of the macros would trigger incorrectly. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29209'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29209</a>
