<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30547</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-17 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. There exists a vulnerability in exception sanitization of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.16, allowing attackers to raise an unsanitized host exception inside `handleException()` which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.17` of `vm2`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30547'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30547</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30543</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-17 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] @web3-react is a framework for building Ethereum Apps . In affected versions the `chainId` may be outdated if the user changes chains as part of the connection flow. This means that the value of `chainId` returned by `useWeb3React()` may be incorrect. In an application, this means that any data derived from `chainId` could be incorrect. For example, if a swapping application derives a wrapped token contract address from the `chainId` *and* a user has changed chains as part of their connection flow the application could cause the user to send funds to the incorrect address when wrapping. This issue has been addressed in PR #749 and is available in updated npm artifacts. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30541</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-17 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. A function in the implementation contract may be inaccessible if its selector clashes with one of the proxy's own selectors. Specifically, if the clashing function has a different signature with incompatible ABI encoding, the proxy could revert while attempting to decode the arguments from calldata. The probability of an accidental clash is negligible, but one could be caused deliberately and could cause a reduction in availability. The issue has been fixed in version 4.8.3. As a workaround if a function appears to be inaccessible for this reason, it may be possible to craft the calldata such that ABI decoding does not fail at the proxy and the function is properly proxied through.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30541'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30541</a>

In affected versions a user that was added later to a conversation can use this information to get access to data that was deleted before they were added to the conversation. This issue has been patched in version 15.0.5 and it is recommended that users upgrad to 15.0.5.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30539</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-17 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud is a personal home server system. Depending on the set up tags and other workflows this issue can be used to limit access of others or being able to grant them access when there are system tag based files access control or files retention rules. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.11 or 25.0.5, the Nextcloud Enterprise Server to 21.0.9.11, 22.2.10.11, 23.0.12.6, 24.0.11 or 25.0.5, and the Nextcloud Files automated tagging app to 1.11.1, 1.12.1, 1.13.1, 1.14.2, 1.15.3 or 1.16.1. Users unable to upgrade should disable all workflow related apps.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30536</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-17 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] slim/psr7 is a PSR-7 implementation for use with Slim 4. In versions prior to 1.6.1 an attacker could sneak in a newline (\n) into both the header names and values. While the specification states that \r\n\r\n is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept \n\n. An attacker that is able to control the header names that are passed to Slilm-Psr7 would be able to intentionally craft invalid messages, possibly causing application errors or invalid HTTP requests being sent out with an PSR-18 HTTP client. The latter might present a denial of service vector if a remote service’s web application firewall bans the application due to the receipt of malformed requests. The issue has been patched in version 1.6.1. There are no known workarounds to this issue.

In affected versions of `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-logging-ui` it is possible to trick a user with programming rights into visiting a constructed url where e.g., by embedding an image with this URL in a document that is viewed by a user with programming rights which will evaluate an expression in the constructed url and execute it. This issue has been addressed in versions 13.10.11, 14.4.7, and 14.10. Users are advised to upgrade.

Affected versions are subject to improper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a newline (\n) into both the header names and values. While the specification states that \r\n\r\n is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept \n\n. This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-24775 where the fix was incomplete. The issue has been patched in versions 1.9.1 and 2.4.5. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

The PFE may crash when a lot of MAC learning and aging happens, but due to a Race Condition (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization) that is outside the attackers direct control. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 19.4R3-S10 on QFX Series; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S7 on QFX Series; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S6 on QFX Series; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5 on QFX Series; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4 on QFX Series; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S3 on QFX Series; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S3 on QFX Series; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3 on QFX Series; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3 on QFX Series; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2 on QFX Series.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28984'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28984</a>
