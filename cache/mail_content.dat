<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29255</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 09:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In versions prior to 0.3.4 when a calling an external contract with no return value, the contract address (including side effects) could be evaluated twice. This may result in incorrect outcomes for contracts. This issue has been addressed in v0.3.4.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29255'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29255</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29245</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-31 17:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the client&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29245'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29245</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29225</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 20:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 secompressors accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody. This may allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small highly compressed payload. Maliciously constructed zip files may exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may consider disabling decompression.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29225'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29225</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29224</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 19:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. Versions of envoy prior to 1.22.1 are subject to a segmentation fault in the GrpcHealthCheckerImpl. Envoy can perform various types of upstream health checking. One of them uses gRPC. Envoy also has a feature which can &Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&Aring;&ldquo;hold&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;? (prevent removal) upstream hosts obtained via service discovery until configured active health checking fails. If an attacker controls an upstream host and also controls service discovery of that host (via DNS, the EDS API, etc.), an attacker can crash Envoy by forcing removal of the host from service discovery, and then failing the gRPC health check request. This will crash Envoy via a null pointer dereference. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may disable gRPC health checking and/or replace it with a different health checking type as a mitigation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29224'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29224</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29220</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-31 16:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] github-action-merge-dependabot is an action that automatically approves and merges dependabot pull requests (PRs). Prior to version 3.2.0, github-action-merge-dependabot does not check if a commit created by dependabot is verified with the proper GPG key. There is just a check if the actor is set to `dependabot[bot]` to determine if the PR is a legit PR. Theoretically, an owner of a seemingly valid and legit action in the pipeline can check if the PR is created by dependabot and if their own action has enough permissions to modify the PR in the pipeline. If so, they can modify the PR by adding a second seemingly valid and legit commit to the PR, as they can set arbitrarily the username and email in for commits in git. Because the bot only checks if the actor is valid, it would pass the malicious changes through and merge the PR automatically, without getting noticed by project maintainers. It would probably not be possible to determine where the malicious commit came from, as it would only say `dependabot[bot]` and the corresponding email-address. Version 3.2.0 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29220'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29220</a>

The credentials of a user with high privileges are stored in plain text. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29085'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29085</a>

A remote unauthenticated attacker may potentially exploit this vulnerability to brute-force passwords and gain access to the system as the victim. Account takeover is possible if weak passwords are used by users.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29084'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29084</a>

A crafted URL (unvalidated deeplink) can force the com.zhiliaoapp.musically WebView to load an arbitrary website. This may allow an attacker to leverage an attached JavaScript interface for the takeover with one click.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-28799'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-28799</a>
