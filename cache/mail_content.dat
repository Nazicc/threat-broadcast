<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32074</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-25 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] user_oidc app is an OpenID Connect user backend for Nextcloud. Authentication can be broken/bypassed in user_oidc app. It is recommended that the Nextcloud user_oidc app is upgraded to 1.3.2<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32074'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32074</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32067</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-25 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. c-ares is vulnerable to denial of service. If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target resolver. The target resolver erroneously interprets the 0 length as a graceful shutdown of the connection. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32067'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32067</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-2903</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-25 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in NFine Rapid Development Platform 20230511. This affects an unknown part of the file /SystemManage/Role/GetGridJson?keyword=&page=1&rows=20. The manipulation leads to improper access controls. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-229977 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2903'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2903</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-31147</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-25 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When /dev/urandom or RtlGenRandom() are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random numbers used for DNS query ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also not seeded by srand() so will generate predictable output. Input from the random number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4 implementation and may not be as strong as the original RC4 implementation. No attempt is made to look for modern OS-provided CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widely available. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31147'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31147</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-31130</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-25 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. ares_inet_net_pton() is vulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular "0::00:00:00/2" was found to cause an issue.  C-ares only uses this function internally for configuration purposes which would require an administrator to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist(). However, users may externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be vulnerable to more severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31130'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31130</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-31124</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-25 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When cross-compiling c-ares and using the autotools build system, CARES_RANDOM_FILE will not be set, as seen when cross compiling aarch64 android.  This will downgrade to using rand() as a fallback which could allow an attacker to take advantage of the lack of entropy by not using a CSPRNG. This issue was patched in version 1.19.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31124'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31124</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-2804</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-05-25 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo in h2v2_merged_upsample_internal() function of jdmrgext.c file. The vulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for which the range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range, hence, an attacker could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting to decompress such image using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault or buffer overflows, causing an application to crash.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2804'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2804</a>
