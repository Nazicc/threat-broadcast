<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36736</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 13:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Jitsi-2.10.5550 was discovered to contain a vulnerability in its web UI which allows attackers to perform a clickjacking attack via a crafted HTTP request.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36736'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36736</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20923</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 13:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the IPSec VPN Server authentication functionality of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication controls and access the IPSec VPN network. This vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the VPN from an affected device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and access the IPSec VPN network. The attacker may obtain privileges that are the same level as an administrative user, depending on the crafted credentials that are used. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20923'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20923</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20863</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 13:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the messaging interface of Cisco Webex App, formerly Webex Teams, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to manipulate links or other content within the messaging interface. This vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly handle character rendering. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending messages within the application interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the display of links or other content within the interface, potentially allowing the attacker to conduct phishing or spoofing attacks.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20863'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20863</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20696</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-08 13:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the binding configuration of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software containers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker who has access to the VPN0 logical network to also access the messaging service ports on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the messaging server container ports on an affected system lack sufficient protection mechanisms. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the messaging service ports of the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to send network traffic to interfaces within the VPN0 logical network. This network may be restricted to protect logical or physical adjacent networks, depending on device deployment configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and inject messages into the messaging service, which can cause configuration changes or cause the system to reload.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20696'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20696</a>
