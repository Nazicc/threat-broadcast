<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-38503</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-25 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 10.3.0 and prior to version 10.5.0, the permission filters (i.e. `user_created IS $CURRENT_USER`) are not properly checked when using GraphQL subscription resulting in unauthorized users getting event on their subscription which they should not be receiving according to the permissions. This can be any collection but out-of-the box the `directus_users` collection is configured with such a permissions filter allowing you to get updates for other users when changes happen. Version 10.5.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, disable GraphQL subscriptions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38503'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38503</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-38501</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-25 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] copyparty is file server software. Prior to version 1.8.7, the application contains a reflected cross-site scripting via URL-parameter `?k304=...` and `?setck=...`. The worst-case outcome of this is being able to move or delete existing files on the server, or upload new files, using the account of the person who clicks the malicious link. It is recommended to change the passwords of one's copyparty accounts, unless one have inspected one's logs and found no trace of attacks. Version 1.8.7 contains a patch for the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38501'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38501</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-38496</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-25 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Apptainer is an open source container platform. Version 1.2.0-rc.2 introduced an ineffective privilege drop when requesting container network setup, therefore subsequent functions are called with root privileges, the attack surface is rather limited for users but an attacker could possibly craft a starter config to delete any directory on the host filesystems. A security fix has been included in Apptainer 1.2.1. There is no known workaround outside of upgrading to Apptainer 1.2.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38496'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38496</a>
