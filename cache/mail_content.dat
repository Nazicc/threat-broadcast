<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37479</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-17 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Open Enclave is a hardware-agnostic open source library for developing applications that utilize Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments, also known as Enclaves. There are two issues that are mitigated in version 0.19.3. First, Open Enclave SDK does not properly sanitize the `MXCSR` register on enclave entry. This makes applications vulnerable to MXCSR Configuration Dependent Timing (MCDT) attacks, where incorrect `MXCSR` values can impact instruction retirement by at most one cycle, depending on the (secret) data operand value. Please find more details in the guidance from Intel in the references. Second, Open Enclave SDK does not sanitize x86's alignment check flag `RFLAGS.AC` on enclave entry. This opens up the possibility for a side-channel attacker to be notified for every unaligned memory access performed by the enclave. The issue has been addressed in version 0.19.3 and the current master branch. Users will need to recompile their applications against the patched libraries to be protected from this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37479'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37479</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-38409</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-17 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in set_con2fb_map in drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.12. Because an assignment occurs only for the first vc, the fbcon_registered_fb and fbcon_display arrays can be desynchronized in fbcon_mode_deleted (the con2fb_map points at the old fb_info).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38409'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38409</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37476</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-17 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for data processing. A carefully crafted malicious OpenRefine project tar file can be used to trigger arbitrary code execution in the context of the OpenRefine process if a user can be convinced to import it. The vulnerability exists in all versions of OpenRefine up to and including 3.7.3. Users should update to OpenRefine 3.7.4 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should only import OpenRefine projects from trusted sources.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37476'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37476</a>

Using a potentially known IKM value when generating the session master secret key compromises the key generated, allowing an eavesdropper to reconstruct it and potentially allowing access to or meddling with message contents in the session. This issue does not affect client validation of connected servers, nor expose private key information, but could result in an insecure TLS 1.3 session when not controlling both sides of the connection. wolfSSL recommends that TLS 1.3 client side users update the version of wolfSSL used.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3724'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3724</a>
