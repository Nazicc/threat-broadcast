<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28835</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-30 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions the generated fallback password when creating a share was using a weak complexity random number generator, so when the sharer did not change it the password could be guessable to an attacker willing to brute force it. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. This issue only affects users who do not have a password policy enabled, so enabling a password policy is an effective mitigation for users unable to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28835'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28835</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-28833</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-30 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions admins of a server were able to upload a logo or a favicon and to provided a file name which was not restricted and could overwrite files in the appdata directory. Administrators may have access to overwrite these files by other means but this method could be exploited by tricking an admin into uploading a maliciously named file. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting logo files from untrusted sources.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28833'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28833</a>

In versions prior to 4.7.0 when an attacker has physical access to an unlocked device, they may enable the integration into the iOS Files app and bypass the Nextcloud pin/password protection and gain access to a users files. It is recommended that the Nextcloud iOS app is upgraded to 4.7.0.

In versions from 3.7.0 and before 3.24.1 an attacker that has access to the unlocked physical device can bypass the Nextcloud Android Pin/passcode protection via a thirdparty app. This allows to see meta information like sharer, sharees and activity of files. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Android app is upgraded to 3.24.1.

In releases of the 25.0.x branch before 25.0.3 an inefficient fetch operation may impact server performances and/or can lead to a denial of service. This issue has been addressed and it is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.3.

In affected versions when a recipient receives 2 shares with the same name, while a memory cache is configured, the second share will replace the first one instead of being renamed to `{name} (2)`. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.3 or 24.0.9. Users unable to upgrade should avoid sharing 2 folders with the same name to the same user.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28643'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-28643</a>

In affected versions a missing scope validation allowed users to create workflows which are designed to be only available for administrators. Some workflows are designed to be RCE by invoking defined scripts, in order to generate PDFs, invoking webhooks or running scripts on the server. Due to this combination depending on the available apps the issue can result in a RCE at the end. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. Users unable to upgrade should disable app `workflow_scripts` and `workflow_pdf_converter` as a mitigation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26482'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26482</a>

Affected is an unknown function of the file admin/products/controller.php?action=add. The manipulation of the argument image leads to unrestricted upload. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. VDB-224622 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-1734'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-1734</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-23522</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-30 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] MindsDB is an open source machine learning platform. An unsafe extraction is being performed using `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a remotely retrieved tarball. Which may lead to the writing of the extracted files to an unintended location. This vulnerability is sometimes called a **TarSlip** or a **ZipSlip variant**. Unpacking files using the high-level function `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a potentially malicious tarball without validating that the destination file path remained within the intended destination directory may cause files to be overwritten outside the destination directory. An attacker could craft a malicious tarball with a filename path, such as `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, and then serve the archive remotely using a personal bucket `s3`, thus, retrieve the tarball through **mindsdb** and overwrite the system files of the hosting server. This issue has been addressed in version 22.11.4.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting archives from untrusted sources.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-23522'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-23522</a>
