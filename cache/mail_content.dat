<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33960</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-01 17:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OpenProject is web-based project management software. For any OpenProject installation, a `robots.txt` file is generated through the server to denote which routes shall or shall not be accessed by crawlers. These routes contain project identifiers of all public projects in the instance. Prior to version 12.5.6, even if the entire instance is marked as `Login required` and prevents all truly anonymous access, the `/robots.txt` route remains publicly available.Version 12.5.6 has a fix for this issue. Alternatively, users can download a patchfile to apply the patch to any OpenProject version greater than 10.0 As a workaround, one may mark any public project as non-public and give anyone in need of access to the project a membership.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-33960'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-33960</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33956</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-05 20:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kanboard is open source project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Versions prior to 1.2.30 are subject to an Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability present in the application's URL parameter. This vulnerability enables any user to read files uploaded by any other user, regardless of their privileges or restrictions. By Changing the file_id any user can render all the files where MimeType is image uploaded under **/files** directory regard less of uploaded by any user. This vulnerability poses a significant impact and severity to the application's security. By manipulating the URL parameter, an attacker can access sensitive files that should only be available to authorized users. This includes confidential documents or any other type of file stored within the application. The ability to read these files can lead to various detrimental consequences, such as unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, privacy breaches, intellectual property theft, or exposure of trade secrets. Additionally, it could result in legal and regulatory implications, reputation damage, financial losses, and potential compromise of user trust. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-33956'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-33956</a>

In versions 1.7.42 and prior, the "/forgot_password" page has a self-reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by injecting a script into the "email" parameter of the request. While this vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's browser, the impact is limited as it requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. As of time of publication, a patch is not available. Server-side validation should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34452'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34452</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34448</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-14 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to version 1.7.42, the patch for CVE-2022-2073, a server-side template injection vulnerability in Grav leveraging the default `filter()` function, did not block other built-in functions exposed by Twig's Core Extension that could be used to invoke arbitrary unsafe functions, thereby allowing for remote code execution. A patch in version 1.74.2 overrides the built-in Twig `map()` and `reduce()` filter functions in `system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php` to validate the argument passed to the filter in `$arrow`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34448'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34448</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34253</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-14 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to version 1.7.42, the denylist introduced in commit 9d6a2d to prevent dangerous functions from being executed via injection of malicious templates was insufficient and could be easily subverted in multiple ways -- (1) using unsafe functions that are not banned, (2) using capitalised callable names, and (3) using fully-qualified names for referencing callables. Consequently, a low privileged attacker with login access to Grav Admin panel and page creation/update permissions is able to inject malicious templates to obtain remote code execution. A patch in version 1.7.42 improves the denylist.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34253'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34253</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34252</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-14 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to version 1.7.42, there is a logic flaw in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()` function whereby validation against a denylist of unsafe functions is only performed when the argument passed to filter is a string. However, passing an array as a callable argument allows the validation check to be skipped. Consequently, a low privileged attacker with login access to Grav Admin panel and page creation/update permissions is able to inject malicious templates to obtain remote code execution. The vulnerability can be found in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()` function declared in `/system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php`. Version 1.7.42 contains a patch for this issue. End users should also ensure that `twig.undefined_functions` and `twig.undefined_filters` properties in `/path/to/webroot/system/config/system.yaml` configuration file are set to `false` to disallow Twig from treating undefined filters/functions as PHP functions and executing them.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34252'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34252</a>

Versions prior to 1.7.42 are vulnerable to server side template injection. Remote code execution is possible by embedding malicious PHP code on the administrator screen by a user with page editing privileges.
