<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34969</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-08 03:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] D-Bus before 1.15.6 sometimes allows unprivileged users to crash dbus-daemon. If a privileged user with control over the dbus-daemon is using the org.freedesktop.DBus.Monitoring interface to monitor message bus traffic, then an unprivileged user with the ability to connect to the same dbus-daemon can cause a dbus-daemon crash under some circumstances via an unreplyable message. When done on the well-known system bus, this is a denial-of-service vulnerability. The fixed versions are 1.12.28, 1.14.8, and 1.15.6.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34969'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34969</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-2986</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-08 02:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 5.14.2.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34239</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-08 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Gradio is an open-source Python library that is used to build machine learning and data science. Due to a lack of path filtering Gradio does not properly restrict file access to users. Additionally Gradio does not properly restrict the what URLs are proxied. These issues have been addressed in version 3.34.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34239'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34239</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34238</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-08 00:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React. The Gatsby framework prior to versions 4.25.7 and 5.9.1 contain a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the `__file-code-frame` and `__original-stack-frame` paths, exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`). Any file in scope of the development server could potentially be exposed. It should be noted that by default `gatsby develop` is only accessible via the localhost `127.0.0.1`, and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as `--host 0.0.0.0`, `-H 0.0.0.0`, or the `GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable. A patch has been introduced in `gatsby@5.9.1` and `gatsby@4.25.7` which mitigates the issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid exposing their development server to the internet.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34238'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34238</a>
