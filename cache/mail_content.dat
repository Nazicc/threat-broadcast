<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-38500</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to provide cross-site-scripting-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38500'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38500</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-38499</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Starting in version 9.4.0 and prior to versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30, and 12.4.4, in multi-site scenarios, enumerating the HTTP query parameters `id` and `L` allowed out-of-scope access to rendered content in the website frontend. For instance, this allowed visitors to access content of an internal site by adding handcrafted query parameters to the URL of a site that was publicly available. TYPO3 versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30, 12.4.4 fix the problem.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38499'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38499</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-38493</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Armeria is a microservice framework Spring supports Matrix variables. When Spring integration is used, Armeria calls Spring controllers via `TomcatService` or `JettyService` with the path that may contain matrix variables. Prior to version 1.24.3, the Armeria decorators might not invoked because of the matrix variables. If an attacker sends a specially crafted request, the request may bypass the authorizer. Version 1.24.3 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38493'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-38493</a>

Certifi prior to version 2023.07.22 recognizes "e-Tugra" root certificates. e-Tugra's root certificates were subject to an investigation prompted by reporting of security issues in their systems. Certifi 2023.07.22 removes root certificates from "e-Tugra" from the root store.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37920'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37920</a>

A vulnerability allows active sessions associated with an account to remain active even after enabling 2FA. When activating 2FA on a Cal.com account that is logged in on two or more devices, the account stays logged in on the other device(s) stays logged in without having to verify the account owner's identity.

Prior to version 1.9.2, the MSI installer provided on the homepage allows local privilege escalation (LPE) for low privileged users, if already installed. The problem occurs as the repair function of the MSI spawns two administrative CMDs. A simple LPE is possible via a breakout. Version 1.9.2 fixes this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37907'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37907</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37902</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37902'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37902</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37460</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-07-25 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Plexis Archiver is a collection of Plexus components to create archives or extract archives to a directory with a unified `Archiver`/`UnArchiver` API. Prior to version 4.8.0, using AbstractUnArchiver for extracting an archive might lead to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. When extracting an archive with an entry that already exists in the destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist - the `resolveFile()` function will return the symlink's source instead of its target, which will pass the verification that ensures the file will not be extracted outside of the destination directory. Later `Files.newOutputStream()`, that follows symlinks by default,  will actually write the entry's content to the symlink's target. Whoever uses plexus archiver to extract an untrusted archive is vulnerable to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. Version 4.8.0 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37460'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37460</a>
