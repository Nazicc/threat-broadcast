<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20862</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the operating system.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20862'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20862</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20859</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the Disaster Recovery framework of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform certain administrative actions they should not be able to. This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control checks on the affected device. An attacker with read-only privileges could exploit this vulnerability by executing a specific vulnerable command on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a set of administrative actions they should not be able to.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20859'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20859</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20815</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified CM Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20815'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20815</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20813</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-06 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Multiple vulnerabilities in the API and in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow a remote attacker to overwrite arbitrary files or conduct null byte poisoning attacks on an affected device. Note: Cisco Expressway Series refers to the Expressway Control (Expressway-C) device and the Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) device.

This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of multiple simultaneous device registrations on Cisco SSM On-Prem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple device registration requests to Cisco SSM On-Prem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20808'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20808</a>
