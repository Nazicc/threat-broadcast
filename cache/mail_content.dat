<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34364</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-09 07:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A buffer overflow was discovered in Progress DataDirect Connect for ODBC before 08.02.2770 for Oracle. An overly large value for certain options of a connection string may overrun the buffer allocated to process the string value. This allows an attacker to execute code of their choice on an affected host by copying carefully selected data that will be executed as code.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34364'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34364</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34363</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-09 07:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Progress DataDirect Connect for ODBC before 08.02.2770 for Oracle. When using Oracle Advanced Security (OAS) encryption, if an error is encountered initializing the encryption object used to encrypt data, the code falls back to a different encryption mechanism that uses an insecure random number generator to generate the private key. It is possible for a well-placed attacker to predict the output of this random number generator, which could lead to an attacker decrypting traffic between the driver and the database server. The vulnerability does not exist if SSL / TLS encryption is used.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34363'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34363</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-2897</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-09 07:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Brizy Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 2.4.18. This is due to an implicit trust of user-supplied IP addresses in an 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header for the purpose of validating allowed IP addresses against a Maintenance Mode whitelist. Supplying a whitelisted IP address within the 'X-Forwarded-For' header allows maintenance mode to be bypassed and may result in the disclosure of potentially sensitive information or allow access to restricted functionality.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2897'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2897</a>

This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_duplicate_product function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate products via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2896'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2896</a>
