<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23940</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-03 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is a library for secure smart contract development written in Cairo for StarkNet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. `is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to `finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`. As a result, any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these accounts. The issue has been patched in 0.6.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23940'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23940</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23937</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-03 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform: PIM, MDM, CDP, DAM, DXP/CMS & Digital Commerce. The upload functionality for updating user profile does not properly validate the file content-type, allowing any authenticated user to bypass this security check by adding a valid signature (p.e. GIF89) and sending any invalid content-type. This could allow an authenticated attacker to upload HTML files with JS content that will be executed in the context of the domain. This issue has been patched in version 10.5.16.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23937'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23937</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23933</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-03 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OpenSearch Anomaly Detection identifies atypical data and receives automatic notifications. There is an issue with the application of document and field level restrictions in the Anomaly Detection plugin, where users with the Anomaly Detector role can read aggregated numerical data (e.g. averages, sums) of fields that are otherwise restricted to them. This issue only affects authenticated users who were previously granted read access to the indexes containing the restricted fields. This issue has been patched in versions 1.3.8 and 2.6.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23933'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23933</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23925</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-03 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Switcher Client is a JavaScript SDK to work with Switcher API which is cloud-based Feature Flag. Unsanitized input flows into Strategy match operation (EXIST), where it is used to build a regular expression. This may result in a Regular expression Denial of Service attack (reDOS). This issue has been patched in version 3.1.4. As a workaround, avoid using Strategy settings that use REGEX in conjunction with EXIST and NOT_EXIST operations.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23925'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23925</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22474</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-02-03 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-22474'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-22474</a>
