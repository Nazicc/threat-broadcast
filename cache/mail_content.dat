<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31045</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In affected versions ill-formed headers sent to Envoy in certain configurations can lead to unexpected memory access resulting in undefined behavior or crashing. Users are most likely at risk if they have an Istio ingress Gateway exposed to external traffic. This vulnerability has been resolved in versions 1.12.8, 1.13.5, and 1.14.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31045'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31045</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-21499</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] KGDB and KDB allow read and write access to kernel memory, and thus should be restricted during lockdown. An attacker with access to a serial port could trigger the debugger so it is important that the debugger respect the lockdown mode when/if it is triggered. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 6.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31051</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] semantic-release is an open source npm package for automated version management and package publishing. In affected versions secrets that would normally be masked by semantic-release can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that are excluded from uri encoding by `encodeURI`. Occurrence is further limited to execution contexts where push access to the related repository is not available without modifying the repository url to inject credentials. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that secrets that do not contain characters that are excluded from encoding with `encodeURI` when included in a URL are already masked properly.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31051'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31051</a>

Mechanize automatically stores and sends cookies, follows redirects, and can follow links and submit forms. In versions prior to 2.8.5 the Authorization header is leaked after a redirect to a different port on the same site. Users are advised to upgrade to Mechanize v2.8.5 or later.

In versions prior to version 10.0.1 it is possible to add extra information by SQL injection on search pages. In order to exploit this vulnerability a user must be logged in.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29250'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29250</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29228</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter would try to invoke the remaining filters in the chain after emitting a local response, which triggers an ASSERT() in newer versions and corrupts memory on earlier versions. continueDecoding() shouldnâ€™t ever be called from filters after a local reply has been sent. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29228'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29228</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29227</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 if Envoy attempts to send an internal redirect of an HTTP request consisting of more than HTTP headers, thereâ€™s a lifetime bug which can be triggered. If while replaying the request Envoy sends a local reply when the redirect headers are processed, the downstream state indicates that the downstream stream is not complete. On sending the local reply, Envoy will attempt to reset the upstream stream, but as it is actually complete, and deleted, this result in a use-after-free. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade are advised to disable internal redirects if crashes are observed.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29227'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29227</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29226</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-06-09 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter implementation does not include a mechanism for validating access tokens, so by design when the HMAC signed cookie is missing a full authentication flow should be triggered. However, the current implementation assumes that access tokens are always validated thus allowing access in the presence of any access token attached to the request. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29226'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29226</a>
