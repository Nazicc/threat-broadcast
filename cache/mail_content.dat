<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30613</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-24 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. In versions of Kiwi TCMS prior to 12.2, there is no control over what kinds of files can be uploaded. Thus, a malicious actor may upload an `.exe` file or a file containing embedded JavaScript and trick others into clicking on these files, causing vulnerable browsers to execute malicious code on another computer.Kiwi TCMS v12.2 comes with functionality that allows administrators to configure additional upload validator functions which give them more control over what file types are accepted for upload. By default `.exe` are denied. Other files containing the `<script>` tag, regardless of their type are also denied b/c they are a path to XSS attacks. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30613'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30613</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30544</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-24 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In versions of Kiwi TCMS prior to 12.2, users were able to update their email addresses via the `My profile` admin page. This page allowed them to change the email address registered with their account without the ownership verification performed during account registration. Operators of Kiwi TCMS should upgrade to v12.2 or later to receive a patch. No known workarounds exist.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30544'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30544</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-26494</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-24 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] lorawan-stack is an open source LoRaWAN network server. Prior to version 3.24.1, an open redirect exists on the login page of the lorawan stack server, allowing an attacker to supply a user controlled redirect upon sign in. This issue may allows malicious actors to phish users, as users assume they were redirected to the homepage on login. Version 3.24.1 contains a fix.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26494'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26494</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-26061</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-24 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Nokia NetAct before 22 FP2211. On the Scheduled Search tab under the Alarm Reports Dashboard page, users can create a script to inject XSS. Input validation was missing during creation of a scheduled task. For an external attacker, it is very difficult to exploit this, because a few dynamically created parameters such as Jsession-id, a CSRF token, and an Nxsrf token would be needed. The attack can realistically only be performed by an internal user.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26061'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26061</a>
