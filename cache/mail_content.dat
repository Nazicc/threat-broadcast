<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-4022</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-11-16 14:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The SVG Support plugin for WordPress defaults to insecure settings in version 2.5 and 2.5.1. SVG files containing malicious javascript are not sanitized. While version 2.5 adds the ability to sanitize image as they are uploaded, the plugin defaults to disable sanitization and does not restrict SVG upload to only administrators. This allows authenticated attackers, with author-level privileges and higher, to upload malicious SVG files that can be embedded in posts and pages by higher privileged users. Additionally, the embedded JavaScript is also triggered on visiting the image URL, which allows an attacker to execute malicious code in browsers visiting that URL.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4022'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4022</a>

This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the extra_actions function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings including permalinks and site maps, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4021'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4021</a>
