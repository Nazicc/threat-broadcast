The length affects both how many times a parse is attempted (e.g., thousands of times) and the average amount of data for each parse attempt (e.g., millions of bytes).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43669'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43669</a>

Affected versions are subject to an authentication bypass when specially crafted requests are sent to sing-box. This affects all SOCKS5 inbounds with user authentication and an attacker may be able to bypass authentication. Users are advised to update to sing-box 1.4.4 or to 1.5.0-rc.4. Users unable to update should not expose the SOCKS5 inbound to insecure environments.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43644'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43644</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-43642</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-25 20:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] snappy-java is a Java port of the snappy, a fast C++ compresser/decompresser developed by Google. The SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. All versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3 are vulnerable to this issue. A fix has been introduced in commit `9f8c3cf74` which will be included in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only accept compressed data from trusted sources.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43642'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43642</a>

Prior to version 0.34.0, a SQL injection vulnerability was found in TaxonWorks that allows authenticated attackers to extract arbitrary data from the TaxonWorks database (including the users table). This issue may lead to information disclosure.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-43636</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-20 15:15:12 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In EVE OS, the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;measured boot&acirc;&euro;&#65533; mechanism prevents a compromised device from accessingthe encrypted data located in the vault.As per the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;measured boot&acirc;&euro;&#65533; design, the PCR values calculated at different stages of the bootprocess will change if any of their respective parts are changed.This includes, among other things, the configuration of the bios, grub, the kernel cmdline,initrd, and more.However, this mechanism does not validate the entire rootfs, so an attacker can edit thefilesystem and gain control over the system.As the default filesystem used by EVE OS is squashfs, this is somewhat harder than an ext4,which is easily changeable.This will not stop an attacker, as an attacker can repackage the squashfs with their changesin it and replace the partition altogether.This can also be done directly on the device, as the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;003-storage-init&acirc;&euro;&#65533; container contains the&acirc;&euro;&oelig;mksquashfs&acirc;&euro;&#65533; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;unsquashfs&acirc;&euro;&#65533; binaries (with the corresponding libs).An attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values, thus nottriggering the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;measured boot&acirc;&euro;&#65533; mechanism, and having full access to the vault.Note:This issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure to Zededa), where the configpartition measurement was added to PCR13:&acirc;&euro;&cent; aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141&acirc;&euro;&cent; 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.This issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but it was not included in the measured boot.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43636'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43636</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-43635</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-20 15:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Vault Key Sealed With SHA1 PCRsThe measured boot solution implemented in EVE OS leans on a PCR locking mechanism.Different parts of the system update different PCR values in the TPM, resulting in a uniquevalue for each PCR entry.These PCRs are then used in order to seal/unseal a key from the TPM which is used toencrypt/decrypt the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;vault&acirc;&euro;&#65533; directory.This &acirc;&euro;&oelig;vault&acirc;&euro;&#65533; directory is the most sensitive point in the system and as such, its content shouldbe protected.This mechanism is noted in Zededa&acirc;&euro;&trade;s documentation as the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;measured boot&acirc;&euro;&#65533; mechanism,designed to protect said &acirc;&euro;&oelig;vault&acirc;&euro;&#65533;.The code that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s responsible for generating and fetching the key from the TPM assumes thatSHA256 PCRs are used in order to seal/unseal the key, and as such their presence is beingchecked.The issue here is that the key is not sealed using SHA256 PCRs, but using SHA1 PCRs.This leads to several issues:&acirc;&euro;&cent; Machines that have their SHA256 PCRs enabled but SHA1 PCRs disabled, as wellas not sealing their keys at all, meaning the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;vault&acirc;&euro;&#65533; is not protected from an attacker.&acirc;&euro;&cent; SHA1 is considered insecure and reduces the complexity level required to unseal thekey in machines which have their SHA1 PCRs enabled.An attacker can very easily retrieve the contents of the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;vault&acirc;&euro;&#65533;, which will effectively renderthe &acirc;&euro;&oelig;measured boot&acirc;&euro;&#65533; mechanism meaningless.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43635'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43635</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-43634</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-21 14:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] When sealing/unsealing the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;vault&acirc;&euro;&#65533; key, a list of PCRs is used, which defines which PCRsare used.In a previous project, CYMOTIVE found that the configuration is not protected by the secureboot, and in response Zededa implemented measurements on the config partition that wasmapped to PCR 13.In that process, PCR 13 was added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key.In commit &acirc;&euro;&oelig;56e589749c6ff58ded862d39535d43253b249acf&acirc;&euro;&#65533;, the config partitionmeasurement moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14, but PCR 14 was not added to the list ofPCRs that seal/unseal the key.This change makes the measurement of PCR 14 effectively redundant as it would not affectthe sealing/unsealing of the key.An attacker could modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot, this couldresult in the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents of theencrypted &acirc;&euro;&oelig;vault&acirc;&euro;&#65533;<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43634'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-43634</a>
