<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30858</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-28 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Denosaurs emoji package provides emojis for dinosaurs. Starting in version 0.1.0 and prior to version 0.3.0, the reTrimSpace regex has 2nd degree polynomial inefficiency, leading to a delayed response given a big payload. The issue has been patched in 0.3.0. As a workaround, avoid using the `replace`, `unemojify`, or `strip` functions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30858'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30858</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-30857</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-28 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] @aedart/support is the support package for Ion, a monorepo for JavaScript/TypeScript packages. Prior to version `0.6.1`, there is a possible prototype pollution issue for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from the `@aedart/support` package. The likelihood of exploitation is questionable, given that a class's metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to a security impact. The issue has been patched in version `0.6.1`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30857'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-30857</a>
