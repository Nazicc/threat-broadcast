<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46450</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Sourcecodester Free and Open Source inventory management system 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via the Add supplier function.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46450'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46450</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46449</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Sourcecodester Free and Open Source inventory management system v1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46238</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ZITADEL is an identity infrastructure management system. ZITADEL users can upload their own avatar image using various image types including SVG. SVG can include scripts, such as javascript, which can be executed during rendering. Due to a missing security header, an attacker could inject code to an SVG to gain access to the victim’s account in certain scenarios. A victim would need to directly open the malicious image in the browser, where a single session in ZITADEL needs to be active for this exploit to work. If the possible victim had multiple or no active sessions in ZITADEL, the attack would not succeed. This issue has been patched in version 2.39.2 and 2.38.2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46238'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46238</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46234</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] browserify-sign is a package to duplicate the functionality of node's crypto public key functions, much of this is based on Fedor Indutny's work on indutny/tls.js. An upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature forgery attack. All places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46234'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46234</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-45869</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12) allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary operating system commands remotely, when a highly privileged account accesses an XSS payload. The injected commands are executed via the exec() function in the execQuoted() method of the ilUtil class (/Services/Utilities/classes/class.ilUtil.php) This allows attackers to inject malicious commands into the system, potentially compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the ILIAS installation and the underlying operating system.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-45869'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-45869</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-45868</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Learning Module in ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12 release) allows an attacker (with basic user privileges) to achieve a high-impact Directory Traversal attack on confidentiality and availability. By exploiting this network-based vulnerability, the attacker can move specified directories, normally outside the documentRoot, to a publicly accessible location via the PHP function rename(). This results in a total loss of confidentiality, exposing sensitive resources, and potentially denying access to the affected component and the operating system's components. To exploit this, an attacker must manipulate a POST request during the creation of an exercise unit, by modifying the old_name and new_name parameters via directory traversal. However, it's essential to note that, when exploiting this vulnerability, the specified directory will be relocated from its original location, rendering all files obtained from there unavailable.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-45868'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-45868</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-45867</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-26 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ILIAS (2013-09-12 release) contains a medium-criticality Directory Traversal local file inclusion vulnerability in the ScormAicc module. An attacker with a privileged account, typically holding the tutor role, can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to and potentially retrieve confidential files stored on the web server. The attacker can access files that are readable by the web server user www-data; this may include sensitive configuration files and documents located outside the documentRoot. The vulnerability is exploited by an attacker who manipulates the file parameter in a URL, inserting directory traversal sequences in order to access unauthorized files. This manipulation allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive files, such as /etc/passwd, potentially compromising the system's security. This issue poses a significant risk to confidentiality and is remotely exploitable over the internet.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-45867'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-45867</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-5783</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-26 14:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability has been found in Tongda OA 2017 up to 11.9 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file general/system/approve_center/flow_sort/flow/delete.php. The manipulation of the argument id/sort_parent leads to sql injection. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 11.10 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier VDB-243589 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-5783'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-5783</a>
