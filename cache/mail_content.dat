<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31136</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-07 18:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Bookwyrm is an open source social reading and reviewing program. Versions of Bookwyrm prior to 0.4.1 did not properly sanitize html being rendered to users. Unprivileged users are able to inject scripts into user profiles, book descriptions, and statuses. These vulnerabilities may be exploited as cross site scripting attacks on users viewing these fields. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.4.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31136'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31136</a>

Affected versions of Akashi are subject to a denial of service attack. An attacker can use a specially crafted evidence packet to make an illegal modification, causing a server crash. This can be used to mount a denial-of-service exploit. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31135'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31135</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31133</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-07 18:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] HumHub is an Open Source Enterprise Social Network. Affected versions of HumHub are vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, the attacker would need a permission to administer the Spaces feature. The names of individual &quot;spaces&quot; are not properly escaped and so an attacker with sufficient privilege could insert malicious javascript into a space name and exploit system users who visit that space. It is recommended that the HumHub is upgraded to 1.11.4, 1.10.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31133'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31133</a>

Versions of Nextcloud mail prior to 1.12.2 were found to be missing user account ownership checks when performing tasks related to mail attachments. Attachments may have been exposed to incorrect system users. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail app is upgraded to 1.12.2. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ### Workarounds No workaround available ### References * [Pull request](https://github.com/nextcloud/mail/pull/6600) * [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1579820) ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Create a post in [nextcloud/security-advisories](https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/discussions) * Customers: Open a support ticket at [support.nextcloud.com](https://support.nextcloud.com)<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31131'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31131</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31129</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-06 18:15:19 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. Affected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31129'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31129</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31127</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-06 18:15:19 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, &lt;a href=&quot;http://attacker.com&quot;&gt;Before signing in, claim your money!&lt;/a&gt;`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31127'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31127</a>

A vulnerability in Roxy-wi allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to code execution by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to /app/options.py file. This affects Roxy-wi versions before 6.1.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

A vulnerability in Roxy-wi allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication and access admin functionality by sending a specially crafted HTTP request. This affects Roxywi versions before 6.1.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31124</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-06 18:15:19 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] openssh_key_parser is an open source Python package providing utilities to parse and pack OpenSSH private and public key files. In versions prior to 0.0.6 if a field of a key is shorter than it is declared to be, the parser raises an error with a message containing the raw field value. An attacker able to modify the declared length of a key's sensitive field can thus expose the raw value of that field. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.0.6, which no longer includes the raw field value in the error message. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31124'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31124</a>

In affected versions if a consensus client sends a malformed consensus request to an orderer it may crash the orderer node. A fix has been added in commit 0f1835949 which checks for missing consensus messages and returns an error to the consensus client should the message be missing. Users are advised to upgrade to versions 2.2.7 or v2.4.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31121'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31121</a>
