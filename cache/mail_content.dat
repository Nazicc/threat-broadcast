<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-26473</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-02 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-26472</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-02 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.2-milestone-1, one can execute any wiki content with the right of IconThemeSheet author by creating an icon theme with certain content. This can be done by creating a new page or even through the user profile for users not having edit right. The issue has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10. An available workaround is to fix the bug in the page `IconThemesCode.IconThemeSheet` by applying a modification from commit 48caf7491595238af2b531026a614221d5d61f38.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26472'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26472</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-26471</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-02 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 11.6-rc-1, comments are supposed to be executed with the right of superadmin but in restricted mode (anything dangerous is disabled), but the async macro does not take into account the restricted mode. This means that any user with comment right can use the async macro to make it execute any wiki content with the right of superadmin. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10. The only known workaround consists of applying a patch and rebuilding and redeploying `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26471'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26471</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-26470</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-02 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make the farm unusable by adding an object to a page with a huge number (e.g. 67108863). Most of the time this will fill the memory allocated to XWiki and make it unusable every time this document is manipulated. This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.0-rc-1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26470'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26470</a>
