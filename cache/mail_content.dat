<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-41199</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-10-11 21:15:25 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Due to lack of proper memory management, when a victim opens a manipulated Open Inventor File (.iv, vrml.x3d) file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer - version 9, it is possible that a Remote Code Execution can be triggered when payload forces a stack-based overflow or a re-use of dangling pointer which refers to overwritten space in memory.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41199'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41199</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-37365</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-30 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Hnswlib 0.7.0 has a double free in init_index when the M argument is a large integer.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37365'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-37365</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-36810</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-30 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to unexpected long runtime. This quadratic runtime blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. This issue has been addressed in PR 808 and versions from 1.27.9 include this fix. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-36810'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-36810</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-36807</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-30 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. In version 2.10.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted metadata from such a malformed PDF. Versions prior to 2.10.5 throw an error, but do not hang forever. This issue was fixed with https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1331 which has been included in release 2.10.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should modify `PyPDF2/generic/_data_structures.py::read_object` to an an error throwing case. See GHSA-hm9v-vj3r-r55m for details.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-36807'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-36807</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-36477</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-30 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user with edit rights can edit all pages in the `CKEditor' space. This makes it possible to perform a variety of harmful actions, such as removing technical documents, leading to loss of service and editing the javascript configuration of CKEditor, leading to persistent XSS. This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and XWiki 15.1. This issue has been patched on the CKEditor Integration extension 1.64.9 for XWiki version older than 14.6RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually address the issue by restricting the `edit` and `delete` rights to a trusted user or group (e.g. the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group), implicitly disabling those rights for all other users. See commit `9d9d86179` for details.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-36477'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-36477</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-3485</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-30 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Insecure defaults in open-source Temporal Server before version 1.20 on all platforms allows an attacker to craft a task token with access to a namespace other than the one specified in the request. Creation of this task token must be done outside of the normal Temporal server flow. It requires the namespace UUID and information from the workflow history for the target namespace. Under these conditions, it is possible to interfere with pending tasks in other namespaces, such as marking a task failed or completed.If a task is targeted for completion by the attacker, the targeted namespace must also be using the same data converter configuration as the initial, valid, namespace for the task completion payload to be decoded by workers in the target namespace.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3485'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3485</a>
