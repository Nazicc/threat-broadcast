This passcode is only four digits, far below typical length/complexity for a user account's password.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-40297'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-40297</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-39215</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-15 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked. The issue has been resolved in version 1.0.6 and the implementation now properly checks if the requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39215'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39215</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-39213</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-15 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] go-cvss is a Go module to manipulate Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In affected versions when a full CVSS v2.0 vector string is parsed using `ParseVector`, an Out-of-Bounds Read is possible due to a lack of tests. The Go module will then panic. The problem is patched in tag `v0.4.0`, by the commit `d9d478ff0c13b8b09ace030db9262f3c2fe031f4`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may avoid this issue by parsing only CVSS v2.0 vector strings that do not have all attributes defined (e.g. `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:H/CR:M/IR:M/AR:M`). As stated in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/pandatix/go-cvss/blob/master/SECURITY.md), the CPE v2.3 to refer to this Go module is `cpe:2.3:a:pandatix:go_cvss:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`. The entry has already been requested to the NVD CPE dictionary.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39213'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-39213</a>

Users with limited access can see file names in certain cases where they do not have privilege to do so. This issue has been addressed and it is recommended that the Nextcloud Files Access Control app is upgraded to 1.12.2, 1.13.1 or 1.14.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36075'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36075</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36074</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-15 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Nextcloud server is an open source personal cloud product. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure which fails to strip the Authorization header on HTTP downgrade. This can lead to account access exposure and compromise. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 23.0.7 or 24.0.3. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 22.2.11, 23.0.7 or 24.0.3. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36074'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36074</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-29240</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-09-15 22:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Scylla is a real-time big data database that is API-compatible with Apache Cassandra and Amazon DynamoDB. When decompressing CQL frame received from user, Scylla assumes that user-provided uncompressed length is correct. If user provides fake length, that is greater than the real one, part of decompression buffer won't be overwritten, and will be left uninitialized. This can be exploited in several ways, depending on the privileges of the user. 1. The main exploit is that an attacker with access to CQL port, but no user account, can bypass authentication, but only if there are other legitimate clients making connections to the cluster, and they use LZ4. 2. Attacker that already has a user account on the cluster can read parts of uninitialized memory, which can contain things like passwords of other users or fragments of other queries / results, which leads to authorization bypass and sensitive information disclosure. The bug has been patched in the following versions: Scylla Enterprise: 2020.1.14, 2021.1.12, 2022.1.0. Scylla Open Source: 4.6.7, 5.0.3. Users unable to upgrade should make sure none of their drivers connect to cluster using LZ4 compression, and that Scylla CQL port is behind firewall. Additionally make sure no untrusted client can connect to Scylla, by setting up authentication and applying workarounds from previous point (firewall, no lz4 compression).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29240'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-29240</a>
