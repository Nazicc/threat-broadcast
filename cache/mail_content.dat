<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-41899</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-19 23:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Home assistant is an open source home automation. In affected versions the `hassio.addon_stdin` is vulnerable to a partial Server-Side Request Forgery where an attacker capable of calling this service (e.g.: through GHSA-h2jp-7grc-9xpp) may be able to invoke any Supervisor REST API endpoints with a POST request. An attacker able to exploit will be able to control the data dictionary, including its addon and input key/values. This issue has been addressed in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report: `GHSL-2023-162`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-41899'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-41899</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-41898</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-19 23:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Home assistant is an open source home automation. The Home Assistant Companion for Android app up to version 2023.8.2 is vulnerable to arbitrary URL loading in a WebView. This enables all sorts of attacks, including arbitrary JavaScript execution, limited native code execution, and credential theft. This issue has been patched in version 2023.9.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report: `GHSL-2023-142`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-41898'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-41898</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-41897</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-19 23:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Home assistant is an open source home automation. Home Assistant server does not set any HTTP security headers, including the X-Frame-Options header, which specifies whether the web page is allowed to be framed. The omission of this and correlating headers facilitates covert clickjacking attacks and alternative exploit opportunities, such as the vector described in this security advisory. This fault incurs major risk, considering the ability to trick users into installing an external and malicious add-on with minimal user interaction, which would enable Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Home Assistant application. This issue has been addressed in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-41897'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-41897</a>
