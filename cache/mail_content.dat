<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-48708</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-11-24 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] CodeIgniter Shield is an authentication and authorization provider for CodeIgniter 4. In affected versions successful login attempts are recorded with the raw tokens stored in the log table. If a malicious person somehow views the data in the log table they can obtain a raw token which can then be used to send a request with that user's authority. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0-beta.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable logging for successful login attempts by the configuration files.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48708'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48708</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-48707</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-11-24 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] CodeIgniter Shield is an authentication and authorization provider for CodeIgniter 4. The `secretKey` value is an important key for HMAC SHA256 authentication and in affected versions was stored in the database in cleartext form. If a malicious person somehow had access to the data in the database, they could use the key and secretKey for HMAC SHA256 authentication to send requests impersonating that corresponding user. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0-beta.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48707'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48707</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-48312</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-11-24 18:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for the capsule operator project. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability which is based on a missing check if the user is authenticated based on the `TokenReview` result. All the clusters running with the `anonymous-auth` Kubernetes API Server setting disable (set to `false`) are affected since it would be possible to bypass the token review mechanism, interacting with the upper Kubernetes API Server. This privilege escalation cannot be exploited if you're relying only on client certificates (SSL/TLS). This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.4.6. Users are advised to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48312'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48312</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-48712</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-11-24 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Warpgate is an open source SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion host for Linux. In affected versions there is a privilege escalation vulnerability through a non-admin user's account. Limited users can impersonate another user's account if only single-factor authentication is configured. If a user knows an admin username, opens the login screen and attempts to authenticate with an incorrect password they can subsequently enter a valid non-admin username and password they will be logged in as the admin user. All installations prior to version 0.9.0 are affected. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48712'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48712</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-48711</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-11-24 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] google-translate-api-browser is an npm package which interfaces with the google translate web api. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability is present in applications utilizing the `google-translate-api-browser` package and exposing the `translateOptions` to the end user. An attacker can set a malicious `tld`, causing the application to return unsafe URLs pointing towards local resources. The `translateOptions.tld` field is not properly sanitized before being placed in the Google translate URL. This can allow an attacker with control over the `translateOptions` to set the `tld` to a payload such as `@127.0.0.1`. This causes the full URL to become `https://translate.google.@127.0.0.1/...`, where `translate.google.` is the username used to connect to localhost. An attacker can send requests within internal networks and the local host. Should any HTTPS application be present on the internal network with a vulnerability exploitable via a GET call, then it would be possible to exploit this using this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48711'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-48711</a>
