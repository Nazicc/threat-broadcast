<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20588</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-08 18:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A division-by-zero error on some AMD processors can potentially return speculative data resulting in loss of confidentiality.&Acirc;&nbsp;<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20588'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20588</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20569</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-08 18:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A side channel vulnerability on some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled?address, potentially leading to information disclosure.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20569'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20569</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20269</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-06 18:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the remote access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a brute force attack in an attempt to identify valid username and password combinations or an authenticated, remote attacker to establish a clientless SSL VPN session with an unauthorized user. This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) between the remote access VPN feature and the HTTPS management and site-to-site VPN features. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to achieve one or both of the following:  Identify valid credentials that could then be used to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN session. Establish a clientless SSL VPN session (only when running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier).  Notes:  Establishing a client-based remote access VPN tunnel is not possible as these default connection profiles/tunnel groups do not and cannot have an IP address pool configured. This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to bypass authentication. To successfully establish a remote access VPN session, valid credentials are required, including a valid second factor if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is configured.  Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20269'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20269</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20238</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-06 18:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the single sign-on (SSO) implementation of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to forge the credentials required to access an affected system. This vulnerability is due to the method used to validate SSO tokens. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application with forged credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to commit toll fraud or to execute commands at the privilege level of the forged account. If that account is an Administrator account, the attacker would have the ability to view confidential information, modify customer settings, or modify settings for other users. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need a valid user ID that is associated with an affected Cisco BroadWorks system.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20238'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20238</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20236</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the iPXE boot function of Cisco IOS XR software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to install an unverified software image on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient image verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the boot parameters for image verification during the iPXE boot process on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot an unverified software image on the affected device.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20236'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20236</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20233</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of invalid continuity check messages (CCMs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CCMs to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CFM service to crash when a user displays information about maintenance end points (MEPs) for peer MEPs on an affected device.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20233'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-20233</a>
