<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-26307</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-25 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user’s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26307'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26307</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-26306</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-25 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user’s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where the required initialization vector for encryption was always the same which weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the user's configuration data. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26306'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26306</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-26305</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-25 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existed where determining if a macro was signed by a trusted author was done by only matching the serial number and issuer string of the used certificate with that of a trusted certificate. This is not sufficient to verify that the macro was actually signed with the certificate. An adversary could therefore create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26305'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-26305</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-2131</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-25 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OpenKM Community Edition in its 6.3.10 version and before was using XMLReader parser in XMLTextExtractor.java file without the required security flags, allowing an attacker to perform a XML external entity injection attack.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-2131'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-2131</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-40336</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-25 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user’s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-40336'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-40336</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2021-40335</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-07-25 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability exists in the HTTP web interface where the web interface does not sufficiently verify if a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. This cause a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which if exploited could lead an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the web application and perform an unwanted operation on it without the knowledge of the legitimate user. An attacker, who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., link is sent per E-Mail, could perform harmful command on MSM through its web server interface. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-40335'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-40335</a>
