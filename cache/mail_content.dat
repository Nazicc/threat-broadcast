<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-27043</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Yearning versions 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 Interstellar GA and 2.3.4 - 2.3.6 Neptune is vulnerable to Directory Traversal.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-27043'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-27043</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20761</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the integrated wireless access point (AP) packet processing of the Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Router (CGR1K) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the integrated AP to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. It may be necessary to manually reload the CGR1K to restore AP operation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20761'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20761</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20758</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must control a BGP speaker that has an established trusted peer connection to an affected device that is configured with the address family L2VPN EVPN to receive and process the update message. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by any data that is initiated by clients on the Layer 2 network or by peers that are not configured to accept the L2VPN EVPN address family. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP updates only from explicitly defined peers. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the malicious BGP update message must either come from a configured, valid BGP peer or be injected by the attacker into the affected BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20758'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20758</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20747</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the History API of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient API authorization checking on the underlying operating system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to Cisco vManage as a lower-privileged user and gaining access to sensitive information that they would not normally be authorized to access.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20747'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20747</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20739</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user. The attacker must be authenticated on the affected system as a low-privileged user to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because a file leveraged by a root user is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a specific file as a lower-privileged user and then waiting until an admin user executes specific commands. The commands would then be executed on the device by the root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected system from a low-privileged user to the root user.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20739'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20739</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-20735</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-15 15:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. These actions could include modifying the system configuration and deleting accounts.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20735'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-20735</a>
