<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31011</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-31 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] TiDB is an open-source NewSQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. Under certain conditions, an attacker can construct malicious authentication requests to bypass the authentication process, resulting in privilege escalation or unauthorized access. Only users using TiDB 5.3.0 are affected by this vulnerability. TiDB version 5.3.1 contains a patch for this issue. Other mitigation strategies include turning off Security Enhanced Mode (SEM), disabling local login for non-root accounts, and ensuring that the same IP cannot be logged in as root and normal user at the same time.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31011'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31011</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31007</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-31 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] eLabFTW is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. Prior to version 4.3.0, a vulnerability allows an authenticated user with an administrator role in a team to assign itself system administrator privileges within the application, or create a new system administrator account. The issue has been corrected in eLabFTW version 4.3.0. In the context of eLabFTW, an administrator is a user account with certain privileges to manage users and content in their assigned team/teams. A system administrator account can manage all accounts, teams and edit system-wide settings within the application. The impact is not deemed as high, as it requires the attacker to have access to an administrator account. Regular user accounts cannot exploit this to gain admin rights. A workaround for one if the issues is removing the ability of administrators to create accounts.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31007'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31007</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31005</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-31 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Vapor is an HTTP web framework for Swift. Users of Vapor prior to version 4.60.3 with FileMiddleware enabled are vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability that can crash the application. Version 4.60.3 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable FileMiddleware and serve via a Content Delivery Network.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31005'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31005</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31003</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-31 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, when parsing each line of a sdp message, `rest = record + 2` will access the memory behind `\0` and cause an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, causing a crash or more serious consequence, such as remote code execution. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31003'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31003</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31001</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-31 20:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may cause crash. This type of crash may be caused by `#define MATCH(s, m) (strncmp(s, m, n = sizeof(m) - 1) == 0)`, which will make `n` bigger and trigger out-of-bound access when `IS_NON_WS(s[n])`. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31001'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-31001</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-31002</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-05-31 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may cause a crash. This type of crash may be caused by a URL ending with `%`.
