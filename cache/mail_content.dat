<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33953</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-09 13:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS attacks:- Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser- Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parserThe unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred per-input-block in the parser, and because that could be unbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop, with n selected by the client.The unbounded memory buffering bugs:- The header size limit check was behind the string reading code, so we needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb.- HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0’s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack parser needed to read all of them before concluding a parse.- gRPC’s metadata overflow check was performed per frame, so that the following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc…<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33953'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33953</a>

Due to command-line parameter injection and an undocumented debug feature flag, an attacker can utilize the DICOM sensor to write arbitrary data to the disk. This can be utilized to write a custom EXE(.bat) sensor, that will then run. This primitive gives remote code execution.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32782'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32782</a>

The NetApp Volume Sensor transmits cleartext credentials over the network when the HTTP protocol is selected. This can be triggered remotely via a CSRF by simply sending a controls/addsensor3.htm link to a logged-in victim.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31452'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31452</a>

To exploit the vulnerability, a authenticated user can create a SQL Sensor. When creating this sensor, the user can set the SQL message that should be sent from the PRTG device. This input parameter contains a path traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to choose arbitrary files from the system. They will be transmitted over the internet to the attacker's machine.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31450'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-31450</a>
