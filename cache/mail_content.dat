<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-38152</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-08-31 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS 1.3 client connects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on its session, the server crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs in the second session, which is created through TLS session resumption and reuses the initial struct WOLFSSL. If the server reuses the previous session structure (struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL* ssl) on it, the next received Client Hello (that resumes the previous session) crashes the server. Note that this bug is only triggered when resuming sessions using TLS session resumption. Only servers that use wolfSSL_clear instead of the recommended SSL_free; SSL_new sequence are affected. Furthermore, wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's compatibility layer and is not enabled by default. It is not part of wolfSSL's native API.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-38152'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-38152</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-37122</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-08-31 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Carel pCOWeb HVAC BACnet Gateway 2.1.0, Firmware: A2.1.0 - B2.1.0, Application Software: 2.15.4A Software v16 13020200 suffers from an unauthenticated arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability. Input passed through the 'file' GET parameter through the 'logdownload.cgi' Bash script is not properly verified before being used to download log files. This can be exploited to disclose the contents of arbitrary and sensitive files via directory traversal attacks.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-37122'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-37122</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-30318</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-08-31 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Honeywell ControlEdge through R151.1 uses Hard-coded Credentials. According to FSCT-2022-0056, there is a Honeywell ControlEdge hardcoded credentials issue. The affected components are characterized as: SSH. The potential impact is: Remote code execution, manipulate configuration, denial of service. The Honeywell ControlEdge PLC and RTU product line exposes an SSH service on port 22/TCP. Login as root to this service is permitted and credentials for the root user are hardcoded without automatically changing them upon first commissioning. The credentials for the SSH service are hardcoded in the firmware. The credentials grant an attacker access to a root shell on the PLC/RTU, allowing for remote code execution, configuration manipulation and denial of service.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30318'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30318</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-30317</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-08-31 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Honeywell Experion LX through 2022-05-06 has Missing Authentication for a Critical Function. According to FSCT-2022-0055, there is a Honeywell Experion LX Control Data Access (CDA) EpicMo protocol with unauthenticated functionality issue. The affected components are characterized as: Honeywell Control Data Access (CDA) EpicMo (55565/TCP). The potential impact is: Firmware manipulation, Denial of service. The Honeywell Experion LX Distributed Control System (DCS) utilizes the Control Data Access (CDA) EpicMo protocol (55565/TCP) for device diagnostics and maintenance purposes. This protocol does not have any authentication features, allowing any attacker capable of communicating with the ports in question to invoke (a subset of) desired functionality. There is no authentication functionality on the protocol in question. An attacker capable of invoking the protocols' functionalities could issue firmware download commands potentially allowing for firmware manipulation and reboot devices causing denial of service.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30317'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-30317</a>
