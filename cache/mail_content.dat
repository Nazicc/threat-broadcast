<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34103</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-05 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. In affected versions some avo fields are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) when rendering html based content. Attackers do need form edit privilege in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, but the results are stored and no specific timing is required. This issue has been addressed in commit `7891c01e` which is expected to be included in the next release of avo. Users are advised to configure CSP headers for their application and to limit untrusted user access as a mitigation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34103'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34103</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-34102</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-05 23:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. The polymorphic field type stores the classes to operate on when updating a record with user input, and does not validate them in the back end. This can lead to unexpected behavior, remote code execution, or application crashes when viewing a manipulated record. This issue has been addressed in commit `ec117882d` which is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to limit access to untrusted users until a new release is made.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34102'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-34102</a>

The propagator allows policies which contain some dynamically obtained values (instead of the policy apply a static manifest on a managed cluster) of taking advantage of cluster scoped access in a created policy. This feature does not restrict properly to lookup content from the namespace where the policy was created.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3027'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3027</a>
