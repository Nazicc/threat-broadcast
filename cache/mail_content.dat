<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-23488</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-12-17 01:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied.

There are no workarounds.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-23488'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-23488</a>
