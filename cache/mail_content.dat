<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-23938</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-20 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Tuleap is a Free & Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. Affected versions are subject to a cross site scripting attack which can be injected in the name of a color of select box values of a tracker and then reflected in the tracker administration. Administrative privilege is required, but an attacker with tracker administration rights could use this vulnerability to force a victim to execute uncontrolled code in the context of their browser. This issue has been addressed in Tuleap Community Edition version 14.5.99.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23938'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-23938</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-1255</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-20 17:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARMplatform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,leading to a crash.Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARMplatform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usuallyused for disk encryption.The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will readpast the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5, e.g.144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer isunmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service.If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext bufferbeing decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, theapplication is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issuea Low severity one.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-1255'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-1255</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-27351</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of PaperCut NG PaperCut NG 22.0.5 (Build 63914). Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SecurityRequestFilter class. The issue results from improper implementation of the authentication algorithm. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-27350</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of PaperCut NG PaperCut NG 22.0.5 (Build 63914). Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SetupCompleted class. The issue results from improper access control. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-25601</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] On version 3.0.0 through 3.1.1, Apache DolphinScheduler's python gateway suffered from improper authentication: an attacker could use a socket bytes attack without authentication. This issue has been fixed from version 3.1.2 onwards. For users who use version 3.0.0 to 3.1.1, you can turn off the python-gateway function by changing the value `python-gateway.enabled=false` in configuration file `application.yaml`. If you are using the python gateway, please upgrade to version 3.1.2 or above.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-25601'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-25601</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-36788</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-04-20 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TriangleMesh clone functionality of Slic3r libslic3r 1.3.0 and Master Commit b1a5500. A specially-crafted STL file can lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36788'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-36788</a>
