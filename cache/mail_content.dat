<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-26604</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-03 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] systemd before 247 does not adequately block local privilege escalation for some Sudo configurations, e.g., plausible sudoers files in which the "systemctl status" command may be executed. Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less program. This presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl from Sudo, because less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl output.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26604'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-26604</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20104</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-03 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the file upload functionality of Cisco Webex App for Web could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an arbitrary file to a user and persuading that user to browse to a specific URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20104'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20104</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20088</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-03 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the nginx configurations that are provided as part of the VPN-less reverse proxy for Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition for new and existing users who are connected through a load balancer. This vulnerability is due to improper IP address filtering by the reverse proxy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unauthenticated requests to the reverse proxy. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all current traffic and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20088'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20088</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20069</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-03 16:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20069'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20069</a>
