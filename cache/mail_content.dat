<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24863</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-18 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] http-swagger is an open source wrapper to automatically generate RESTful API documentation with Swagger 2.0. In versions of http-swagger prior to 1.2.6 an attacker may perform a denial of service attack consisting of memory exhaustion on the host system. The cause of the memory exhaustion is down to improper handling of http methods. Users are advised to upgrade.  Users unable to upgrade may to restrict the path prefix to the "GET" method as a workaround.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24863'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24863</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2022-24859</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2022-04-18 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] PyPDF2 is an open source python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. In versions prior to 1.27.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 if the code attempts to get the content stream. The reason is that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage` only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24859'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-24859</a>
