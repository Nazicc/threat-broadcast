<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-44821</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-09 20:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ** DISPUTED ** Gifsicle through 1.94, if deployed in a way that allows untrusted input to affect Gif_Realloc calls, might allow a denial of service (memory consumption). NOTE: this has been disputed by multiple parties because the Gifsicle code is not commonly used for unattended operation in which new input arrives for a long-running process, does not ship with functionality to link it into another application as a library, and does not have realistic use cases in which an adversary controls the entire command line.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44821'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44821</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-44399</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-10-10 17:15:13 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. In versions 2.37.2 and prior, ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called &quot;Ignoring unknown usernames&quot; which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. While this settings was properly working during the authentication process it did not work correctly on the password reset flow. This meant that even if this feature was active that an attacker could use the password reset function to verify if an account exist within ZITADEL. This bug has been patched in versions 2.37.3 and 2.38.0. No known workarounds are available.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44399'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44399</a>

Due to insufficient access-level checks on the Wiki redirection page, any user can reveal private Projects' names, by accessing wiki.php with sequentially incremented IDs. This issue has been addressed in commit `65c44883f` which has been included in release `2.258`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable wiki integration ( `$g_wiki_enable = OFF;`).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44394'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-44394</a>
