<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22410</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-13 00:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series platforms with MPC10/MPC11 line cards, allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). Devices are only vulnerable when the Suspicious Control Flow Detection (scfd) feature is enabled. Upon enabling this specific feature, an attacker sending specific traffic is causing memory to be allocated dynamically and it is not freed. Memory is not freed even after deactivating this feature. Sustained processing of such traffic will eventually lead to an out of memory condition that prevents all services from continuing to function, and requires a manual restart to recover. The FPC memory usage can be monitored using the CLI command &quot;show chassis fpc&quot;. On running the above command, the memory of AftDdosScfdFlow can be observed to detect the memory leak. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series: All versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22410'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22410</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22407</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-13 00:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). An rpd crash can occur when an MPLS TE tunnel configuration change occurs on a directly connected router. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions prior to 18.4R2-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 19.2R3-EVO; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-EVO; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-EVO; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-EVO; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-EVO.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22407'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22407</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-22403</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-01-13 00:15:10 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). On QFX10k Series Inter-Chassis Control Protocol (ICCP) is used in MC-LAG topologies to exchange control information between the devices in the topology. ICCP connection flaps and sync issues will be observed due to excessive specific traffic to the local device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: All versions prior to 20.2R3-S7; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22403'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22403</a>
