<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-33977</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and automated testing. Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files from being uploaded and Content-Security-Policy definition to prevent cross-site-scripting attacks. The upload validation checks were not 100% robust which left the possibility to circumvent them and upload a potentially dangerous file which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. Additionally we've discovered that Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive will strip some headers negating protections built into Kiwi TCMS when served behind a reverse proxy. This issue has been addressed in version 12.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade who are serving Kiwi TCMS behind a reverse proxy should make sure that additional header values are still passed to the client browser. If they aren't redefining them inside the proxy configuration.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33977'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33977</a>

An attacker who has compromised a registry can cause users to verify the wrong artifact. The problem has been fixed in the release v1.0.0-rc.6. Users should upgrade their notation-go library to v1.0.0-rc.6 or above. Users unable to upgrade may restrict container registries to a set of secure and trusted container registries.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33959'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33959</a>

An attacker who has compromised a registry and added a high number of signatures to an artifact can cause denial of service of services on the machine, if a user runs notation verify command on the same machine. The problem has been fixed in the release v1.0.0-rc.6. Users should upgrade their notation packages to v1.0.0-rc.6 or above. Users unable to upgrade may restrict container registries to a set of secure and trusted container registries.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33958'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-33958</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32683</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted framework. A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the `url_preview_url_blacklist` setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` setting (by default this only allows public IPs) and by the limited information returned to the client: 1. For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSON response or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is discarded. 2. For discovered image URLs, any non-image response is discarded. Systems which have URL preview disabled (via the `url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a `url_preview_url_blacklist` are not affected. This issue has been addressed in version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade. User unable to upgrade may also disable URL previews.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32683'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32683</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32682</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted framework. In affected versions it may be possible for a deactivated user to login when using uncommon configurations. This only applies if any of the following are true: 1. JSON Web Tokens are enabled for login via the `jwt_config.enabled` configuration setting. 2. The local password database is enabled via the `password_config.enabled` and `password_config.localdb_enabled` configuration settings *and* a user's password is updated via an admin API after a user is deactivated. Note that the local password database is enabled by default, but it is uncommon to set a user's password after they've been deactivated. Installations that are configured to only allow login via Single Sign-On (SSO) via CAS, SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC); or via an external password provider (e.g. LDAP) are not affected. If not using JSON Web Tokens, ensure that deactivated users do not have a password set. This issue has been addressed in version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32682'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32682</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-2801</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-06 19:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Using public dashboards users can query multiple distinct data sources using mixed queries. However such query has a possibility of crashing a Grafana instance.The only feature that uses mixed queries at the moment is public dashboards, but it's also possible to cause this by calling the query API directly.This might enable malicious users to crash Grafana instances through that endpoint.Users may upgrade to version 9.4.12 and 9.5.3 to receive a fix.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2801'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2801</a>
