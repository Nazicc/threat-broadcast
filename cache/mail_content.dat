<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-41080</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability in FORM authentication feature Apache Tomcat.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.0.12, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.79 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.92.The vulnerability is limited to the ROOT (default) web application.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-41080'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-41080</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40587</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40587'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40587</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40586</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OWASP Coraza WAF is a golang modsecurity compatible web application firewall library. Due to the misuse of `log.Fatalf`, the application using coraza crashed after receiving crafted requests from attackers. The application will immediately crash after receiving a malicious request that triggers an error in `mime.ParseMediaType`. This issue was patched in version 3.0.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40586'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40586</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40585</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ironic-image is a container image to run OpenStack Ironic as part of Metal³. Prior to version capm3-v1.4.3, if Ironic is not deployed with TLS and it does not have API and Conductor split into separate services, access to the API is not protected by any authentication. Ironic API is also listening in host network. In case the node is not behind a firewall, the API could be accessed by anyone via network without authentication. By default, Ironic API in Metal3 is protected by TLS and basic authentication, so this vulnerability requires operator to configure API without TLS for it to be vulnerable. TLS and authentication however should not be coupled as they are in versions prior to capm3-v1.4.3. A patch exists in versions capm3-v1.4.3 and newer. Some workarounds are available. Either configure TLS for Ironic API (`deploy.sh -t ...`, `IRONIC_TLS_SETUP=true`) or split Ironic API and Conductor via configuration change (old implementation, not recommended). With both workarounds, services are configured with httpd front-end, which has proper authentication configuration in place.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40585'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40585</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40583</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] libp2p is a networking stack and library modularized out of The IPFS Project, and bundled separately for other tools to use. In go-libp2p, by using signed peer records a malicious actor can store an arbitrary amount of data in a remote node’s memory. This memory does not get garbage collected and so the victim can run out of memory and crash. If users of go-libp2p in production are not monitoring memory consumption over time, it could be a silent attack i.e. the attacker could bring down nodes over a period of time (how long depends on the node resources i.e. a go-libp2p node on a virtual server with 4 gb of memory takes about 90 sec to bring down; on a larger server, it might take a bit longer.) This issue was patched in version 0.27.4.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40583'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40583</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40571</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-25 21:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] weblogic-framework is a tool for detecting weblogic vulnerabilities. Versions 0.2.3 and prior do not verify the returned data packets, and there is a deserialization vulnerability which may lead to remote code execution. When weblogic-framework gets the command echo, it directly deserializes the data returned by the server without verifying it. At the same time, the classloader loads a lot of deserialization calls. In this case, the malicious serialized data returned by the server will cause remote code execution. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40571'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40571</a>
